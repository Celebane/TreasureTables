1,"A novel sized slate that is perpetually covering in constantly changing chalk writing that matches it's bearer's thoughts. Only the bearer can see the writing, all other creatures see only a blank slate."
2,"Bane of the Kitchen's Apprentice: A white sous chef hat that causes the bearer to cause any recipe to go awry, no matter their skill or the simplicity of the recipe. The food will come out tasting ghastly anytime the hat is worn while the bearer is cooking."
3,A torn and frayed foot long scarlet ribbon that smells and feels like your mother's skin. It's comforting and causes you to feel oddly guilty that you haven't spoken to her in awhile.
4,"A thick, white rope tied in a circle to be worn as a collar. If the bearer closes their eyes and smells the rope, they catch the scent of a far off ocean breeze. No one except for the bearer experiences this smell."
5,"A hand sized origami paper crane in ^RandomColour^ that will glide ten feet when thrown and always lands gracefully."
6,"A three-inch tall, carved, pine figurine of a comical looking butler. The carving doesn't move, but every once and a while, its owner can see the figurine winking out of the corner of his eye."
7,"A child's stuffed toy in the shape of a moose with a kind smile on its face. It always smells like chocolate, no matter how many times it is washed or how dirty it gets."
8,"A beautiful white and blue china teacup, decorated with a fierce battle between a grizzly bear and a lion, taking place in the ruins of a blood soaked orphanage. There is no context provided for the gorgeous (If gruesome) art, but it does appear that the bear is winning."
9,"A beautiful white and blue china teacup saucer, decorated with a fierce battle between a grizzly bear and a lion, taking place in the ruins of a blood soaked orphanage. There is no context provided for the gorgeous (If gruesome) art, but it does appear that the lion is winning."
10,"A small piece of human leather that has been tattooed with a picture of a six sided die, the number six facing up."
11,"A large women's broach in the shape of a lady bug that looks surprisingly lifelike. Occasionally, the bearer gets a ticklish feeling wherever the broach is pinned to them."
12,"A vibrant, blue jay feather that never frays or bends."
13,"A mid sized, clear corked bottle that appears to be empty. Whenever opened, it releases a light breeze that smells of a clear, spring day in a meadow full of wildflowers."
14,A smooth grey pebble that is always warm to the touch and gives the bearer a feeling of comfort and safety when in their grip.
15,"A flower made of contorted brass, that appears to have been excellently handcrafted in the likeness of a daisy."
16,"A yellowing, delicate, paper fan with a paisley pattern laid on it in gold leaf"
17,"A glass vase hand painted in bright colors, depicting a thriving desert scene with several exotic succulents, cacti, and flowers on it."
18,"A needle that can be threaded on the first attempt, every time. No matter the bearers skill."
19,"A large belt buckle in the startling likeness of a ladybug. When worn, the bearer may occasionally feel a light tickle."
20,"A pair of perfectly round spectacles. The right lens appears broken, but when worn, it improves the bearers vision to a perfect 20/20, the crack unnoticeable."
21,"A child's stuffed black cat with magnificently beautiful green glass eyes. While in the bearer's possession, they will wake up every morning to a dead mouse, rat or bird beside their bed."
22,"An unnecessarily sharp letter opener, filed to a very fine point. The wooden handle sports a beautiful carving of a mermaid resting peacefully under a choppy sea."
23,A distinctly even made cloak pin in the shape of a leaf that makes the bearer yearn for adventures in a far off land.
24,"A clockwork goldfish that never rusts, and swims in figure 8's when wound and put in water."
25,"A palm sized snow globe containing a single bare deciduous tree. The globe never needs to be shaken, it is always snowing inside."
26,"A four-foot long grand tapestry with flour along the bottom, depicting the steps in which to make a pie. On the back, is a recipe written in an unknown language"
27,A clear glass doorknob with a large spider encased inside of it.
28,"A five foot square wire net with clusters of small copper bells hanging at each corner. The net is designed to blanket gear while its owner sleeps, hunts, cooks, or otherwise cannot directly attend to it, and the bells ring out a noticeable alarm if the possessions are disturbed."
29,"A five foot square camouflage net made from a loose mesh of twine and varicolored cloth that can be used to disguise the presence of creatures or large objects. This netting is designed for an X terrain and wouldn't be much use outside of that environment —Note: The DM can choose any appropriate terrain or roll on the following table: 1, Forest. 2, Swamp. 3, Desert. 4, Grasslands. 5, Snow and ice. 6, Mountainous."
30,"A pair of flat wooden skis five feet in length and curled up slightly at the front ends, with lengthwise grooves along the underside and a metal bracket with laces on top for holding the bearer's boot in place. Wearing skis allows the bearer to move on snow and ice at their regular speed, but movement is reduced to five feet per round on all other terrain. Normally a pair of spiked poles are used to help move and maintain balance while skiing, but javelins, shortspears, or even trimmed-down saplings will do if nothing else more suitable is available. Donning or removing the skis normally takes both hands and the better part of a minute."
31,"A tribal battle mask made from wood, bone and dark paints that covers the bearer's face and presents a hateful, leering countenance. The mask show's excellent craftsmanship and sports exquisite details."
32,"A thin, black leather cord with a single small red bead threaded onto it. The bead is freezing cold to touch but causes no harm to the bearer."
33,An armored satchel that provides total cover and protection to any cat sized or smaller creature contained within it. It includes air holes (Which can be plugged with cork stoppers in areas of toxic atmosphere.) and two built in receptacles for food and water. This type of container is most often used by mages to keep their familiars safe during adventures.
34,"Barbed Vest: A black leather dotted with hundreds of tiny, barbed, fishhook-like needles, which are covered in thin leather flaps that prevent harm to the bearer. The barbs function as a last line of defense against close quarter attacks. A creature that injures the bearer with a natural weapon (Claws, teeth, fist, tail swipe) or successfully grapples the bearer has a 50% chance of taking 1 hitpoint's worth of damage as they catch themselves on the barbs. Any creature that swallows the bearer takes 1 point of damage each round until it either spits him up, the bearer escapes, or the bearer dies (At which point the vest has sustained enough damage to no longer serve as a threat). The vest can be worn over simple clothes as well as lighter armors such as padded or studded leather but not over anything heavier."
35,"A clear, 1-inch-thick glass orb the size of a large melon, hanging from a thick chain, with a cap at the top that can be unscrewed for access. The aquarium ball can hold up to two gallons of fresh or saltwater, allowing it to house small aquatic creatures such as fish, frogs, plants, shrimp or crabs. The water within the orb must be changed regularly and any creatures must be fed according to their needs in order to keep the small ecosystem stable."
36,"A sturdy backpack with numerous pockets for storing items that might be needed while adventuring. Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly."
37,"A tall, steel, teapot-like device that contains a small chamber for coffee grounds and a large chamber for water, connected by a small tube. Heating the pot forces boiling water through the tube and into the grounds. A glass knob at the top of the tube allows the user to see the color of the brew and stop when it is sufficiently strong. It can brew up to four cups of coffee at a time. It can also be used to make tea, steep medicinal herbs, or just boil water."
38,"A small, pale blue stone which changes color to resemble a large stone tear when it is hit by the light of the solstice sun."
39,"An ordinary looking black ceramic cup that hides a tiny secret compartment in the thick bottom of the cup which can serve as an excellent place to store a small item or substance. The compartment is designed with a weighted catch that opens when the cup is tilted back, thereby releasing the hidden substance into the contents of the cup. The compartment is hard to spot when the cup is empty and all but impossible to find when filled."
40,"An ornate, white, wooden coffin sized to fit a newborn"
41,"A small wooden case containing what is commonly known as a key blank. The two-sided case contains a soft wax that readily takes and keeps an impression of an object pressed between the two halves, quickly creating an excellent mold of the item. A skilled artisan may then make a copy of the item from the mold (Destroying the mold in the process). Although any item can be copied, most adventures will make copies of stolen keys with this case and then quickly return the originals before the owner is the wiser."
42,A pair of iron manacles meant to be fitted around the ankles rather than the wrists. These fetters are often used along with traditional manacles in order to keep a dangerous prisoner twice as secure. A creature in fetters can only move at half their normal speed and attempting to move faster than that causes the creature to trip and fall.
43,"A pair of false, iron manacles that are nearly indistinguishable from standard ones upon inspection. An extremely perceptive PC can locate a minuscule secret catch in the manacles, which causes them to instantly open if the catch is released."
44,"A pair of iron manacles with wicked barbs on the inside of the cuffs which harm those trying to escape. Creatures that attempt to break free from the manacles, perform complex or forceful actions (such as attacking, casting spells, using most tools or trying to break free) take 1 point of hitpoint damage from the sharp barbs whether the action was successful or not."
45,"A pair of iron manacles with wicked barbs on the inside of the cuffs that are meant to be fitted around the ankles rather than the wrists and harm those trying to escape. These fetters are often used along with traditional manacles in order to keep a dangerous prisoner twice as secure. A creature in fetters can only move at half their normal speed and attempting to move faster than that causes the creature to trip and fall and take 1 hitpoint of damage. Creatures that attempt to break free from the manacles, perform complex or forceful actions (such as attacking, casting spells, using most tools or trying to break free) take 1 point of hitpoint damage from the sharp barbs whether the action was successful or not."
46,"A small, lightweight, wooden altar made for portability. The top of the altar lifts up, and six white candles, two sticks of incense and a vial of oil are stored within. The altar is modest, but could give a traveling priest a center from which to say his daily prayers, perform minor rituals, or preach to an assembled crowd. Strangely enough the altar doesn't sport a single holy symbol to any God, perhaps suggesting the previous owner worshiped several at once, or preached an idea of divinity than than the worship of a single divine being."
47,"A small pair of bellows made of wood and treated burlap. Bellows are used for providing steady, direct bursts of air to a forge or a budding campfire."

62,"A five-day pack of various preserved rations, all of which taste like chicken."
63,An empty green wine bottle made of seemingly indestructible glass.
64,A hamster skeleton that animates and dances whenever music is played. The undead rodent moves to the beat and is disturbingly cute to watch.
65,"An object that can't be accurately described. When someone tries to describe it, they're at a loss for words about even its most basic shape, color, weight or purpose."
66,A costume mask made from a wolf's skull and pelt.
67,A functional lute made entirely out of dry grass.
68,A silver coin that glows red when exposed to methane.
69,A small wooden box containing a blood-stained pommel and a detailed account of a judicial duel.
70,"A flute carved from petrified wood in the shape of a skull that when played, causes all who listen to it feel uneasy."
71,A set of sheet music to a song that cannot be played on any mortal instrument.
72,A pocket sundial that only works in the moonlight.
73,"A red plate made of etched ceramic that, whenever something is eaten off of it a growling noise can be heard from somewhere nearby."
74,"A small pouch that has the words “For Panzer only” written on it. Inside the pouch is a sandwich that is absolutely pristine, fresh and mouth-watering. The vast majority of creatures find they are completely unable to remove, eat, or otherwise interact with the sandwich. Only creatures whose given birth name is Panzer can remove the sandwich and eat it."
75,A glass jar containing two eyeballs peering out with innocence. Its label reads “Lithians treasure” scribbled in crayon.
76,A leather scroll case containing various deeds to a number of different bridges. These are obviously part of a con job centered around selling the deeds to gullible people.
77,"A stained, white leather eye patch with the word “Skipper” stitched on the inside."
78,A woody knob from the end of a wizard's staff. Creature's holding the knob feel the urge to sing bawdy tavern songs.
79,"A hand sized white marble statuette of an angel weeping into it's hands. When no one is watching, it occasionally moves to a nearby location or to a different pouch or bag."
80,A long-stemmed wooden pipe & pouch of dried pipeweed
81,A tarnished silver holy symbol of the God of Secrets. It seems to twist and lean towards anyone sharing a secret or uttering a closely guarded piece of information
82,A pair of extremely lightweight pieces of painted wood that fit together to resemble a bird in flight. This children's toy glider that can reach distances of up to 50 feet when thrown properly.
83,"A ceramic jar filled with a beige waxy glue. This simple glue was created by extensively boiling animal skin, bones, hooves, horn, and tendons until they turn into an ochre syrup that cools when it hardens. Before use, the glue must be heated until it liquefies. It is then applied with a brush and the pieces must be held together for a minute, at which point it is cooled and hardened."
84,A two pronged tuning fork made of steel
85,A two pronged tuning fork made of steel that's constantly humming in F
86,A two pronged tuning fork made of steel that's constantly humming in F unless actually exposed to an F tone at which point it becomes silent.
87,A pair spectacles made of dark glass lenses set in a wire frame that fits most humanoids. The sunglasses reduce the total distance the wearer can see by half but greatly increases their tolerance for bright light.
88,A pair of sunglasses made that fits most humanoid faces. The frames are carved from wood while the lenses are made from thinly shaved horn that fit into grooves in the frame and then glued in place. The sunglasses reduce the total distance the wearer can see by half but greatly increases their tolerance for bright light.
89,"A set of goggles meant to reduce sun glare, carved from a single piece of bone that been shaped to fit the bearer's face, with two narrow horizontal slits carved through the front. Two small holes were bored on either end of the goggles and a leather strap is used to tighten the goggles to the wearer. The goggles fit tightly against the face so that the only light entering is through the slits and soot was applied to the inside to further cut down on glare. The goggles reduce wearer's field of vision by half vertically (The bearer cannot see the ground immediately in front of them or upwards directly above them, if staring forward) but greatly increases their tolerance for bright light."
90,"A cluster of eight desiccated rats whose tails are intertwined in a series of knots. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as a Rat King which is considered a bad omen. Those who touch the Rat King are instantly imbued with the knowledge that these rats were bound together against their will and in their mutual suffering, their consciousness fused together into a single malevolent hive mind called Spider. Knowledgeable PC's will understand they gained this knowledge from the residual psychic energy left in the remains and that Spider must have been extremely powerful in life to leave that much power behind long after it's death."
91,A cluster of thirteen desiccated rats whose tails are intertwined in an incomprehensible series of knots. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as a Rat King which is considered a bad omen of death or destruction even when there are only a few rats involved. A Rat King of thirteen would be considered an omen for the death and destruction of an entire village or small city.
92,"A conical ceramic fire pot one and a half feet tall. The outside of the pot depicts a beautiful oceanic island with a volcano tapering up to the top where fire would exit the pot. A fire pot is typically filled with flammable oil and a wick, wood and kindling or charcoal and then set alight. It is used by travelers who wish to save time constructing a new fire pit at each new campsite and who want a fire they can douse at a moment's notice, ignores wet ground and wind conditions and won't start grass fires. Fire pot's put out half of the typical heat and light of a regular campfire due to their smaller size."
93,"An object made from a cross piece of wood and many colors of brightly woven yarn in a geometric pattern vaguely resembling an eye. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as a “God's Eye” which is a symbol of the power of seeing and understanding that which is unknown and unknowable. The four points represent the elemental processes: earth, fire, air, and water. The weaving of a God's Eye is an ancient contemplative and spiritual practice for many peoples."
94,A smoking pipe made of glass and metal with a rounded bowl bottom that is meant to be filled with water. The design allows the smoke to be filtered through the water allowing for a smoother smoke while still receiving full flavor of the pipeweed.
95,"A tall thick candle whose tallow and wick seem to be made from pure obsidian. The candle appears to be half burned down judging by the amount of melted obsidian “wax” on the base and sides. It does not light by any normal means, but you feel as though a sufficiently powerful magic could command it to burn once more."
96,A roughly-polished stone that is incised with runes spelling out prayers to the god of earth and stone
97,An ivory mask that has been fashioned into the likeness of a human skull.
98,"A folding black leather case, containing half a dozen razor sharp obsidian scalpels."
99,A grotesque drum carved from old bones and covered with the stretched skin of flayed vampires.
100,"An ancient stone tablet on which is chiseled a prayer dedicated to an elder God of madness and destruction, who currently sleeps beneath the waves of the deepest ocean. The words can be read and understood by any sentient creature regardless of their linguistic skills. The prayer reads more like a children's lullaby and attempt to soothe the elder being's slumber and keep the deity dormant in his stone house, cradled by dark waters. Knowledgeable PCs will know that the elder god has no true temple or shrine to its name and its only worshipers are deranged cultists. Wise PC's will realize that a substantial translation enchantment has been placed on this tablet and that perhaps reciting the prayer now and again would be prudent, lest the cosmic horror stir from its hibernation and rise again."
