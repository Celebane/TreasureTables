2,"A stunning broach, embedded with a misty quartz crystal."
3,"A flat, otherwise unremarkable pearlescent-white overcoat button about an inch across. It is heavier than it should have any right to be. It practically vibrates with barely contained magical force."
4,"The severed claw of some monstrous scaled creature, preserved and formed into a camping stool."
5,"A human skull, yellowed with age, with the jawbone wired in place with fine copper wire. The skull has been etched with very fine runes, visible only in bright light, that identify it with the name of “Jerimr”.

6,"An opaque, black eyepatch that the bearer can see through perfectly."

Reward provided—higher if alive. Do not feed or raise from the dead. He bites; wounds will be treated. You kill him, you will be cursed and haunted by something that is utterly unholy and has a somewhat questionable sense of humour.”"
11,"A hand mirror with a butterfly relief on it's non-mirror side while it's reflective surface appears to be a pool of moonlight."
12,"A jointed ceramic finger on a leather thong. A nub of bent and broken metal, whereupon the thong is tied, sticks from the stump like an end of bone ripped from its joint in a whole hand. The finger's two joints may be manipulated with some difficulty, articulated over some rusty armature of metallic bone."
13,"A long arrowhead with only one barb, like a fishhook. The shank is helically grooved, as if meant to screw onto a shaft. No rust, nor any sign of age or wear at all shows on the brilliant, blued alloy from which the point is crafted."

15,"A velvet cloth that erases most scratches, scuffs, and ink when passed over them."

28,"A squat stone goblet made of dark green stone with black intrusions, polished to a silky veneer and carved with capering, vomiting frogs and nonsense rhymes in abyssal. Any liquid poured into this goblet instantly becomes a rancid, foul smelling greenish slime."

30,"A dark crystal orb with the patterns of the night sky revolving within it; a small sun and moon appearing and submerging over time."

37,"A lace-trimmed white silk handkerchief embroidered with the initials 'FLS' and stained in one corner with fresh blood."

65,"A leather mask that is probably depicting the front half of a skull, with two tiny horns stuck on the top. It is sewn of layers, and layers of a strange leather, needing the multiple layers to give it any sort of structural stability. Knowledgeable PC's can determine that the disturbing object is sewn of ancient human skin, taken from bodies long lost under the hungry earth of swamp bogs. Should the bearer wear the mask and make eye contact with another intelligent creature, he feels as though he is just at the cusp of tapping into unfathomable knowledgeable."
66,"An old lute made of ironwood, with strings and tuning keys of glistening steel."
