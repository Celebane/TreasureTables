1,"Anti-dictionary: A huge, leather-wrapped old book with no title, containing thousands of words along with their definitions in the common tongue. Each time it is perused, the reader forgets one random word, and it appears in the dictionary as a new entry."
2,"An  Arbiter's Log: A collection of annotated records of a member of the Arbiter's Guild: the nonpartisan body which referees official duels. The Arbiter in question, one Fralina Dailina Tailor Livii, from Empereoux, governed 221 duels over a career of 30 years in six countries. Her records, put down with both attention to detail and biting wit, serve as a remarkable recent history of dueling."
3,"A collection of maps of the nearby provinces bound in an ebony cover."
4,"Dhol Chants: An aged wood bound book without markings or a title on its exterior. Knowledgeable PC's will notice that an ink stamped marking on the inner cover shows that this book used to belong to the Miskatonic University's library. The object is not just old…it's ancient. The words inside are arranged into stanzas, but the language… It is the tongue of the lumbering dholes of the distant Vale of Pnath, where worlds collide and time does not exist. The letters form meaningless phrases, but if read aloud, somehow become understandable."
5,"An apocryphal holy text used by an infamous heretical sect of ^EvilDomains^."
6,"Tome of Eternal Darkness: A mysterious book that rests cradled in what appears to be a leathery human hand. The tome is bound in human skin and intricately decorated with shrunken bones. The sigil of the God of Chaos is carved into the tome's clasp. The object beckons and yearns to be possessed and rewards those who truly grasp its pages with a cursed, short life of hysterical dementia. Its pages are written in a maddening, indecipherable scrawl. Only a randomly select few are able to read it, no amount of cryptography or magic can decode it. These special few that can read the tome do so regardless of their native language or literacy level. An uneducated, illiterate child slave may be able to understand its contents perfectly well, while a centuries old, elven polyglot archwizard may spend a lifetime failing to discern a single sentence."
7,"A neatly stacked arrangement of professionally bound and labelled debtors' records. Minimal indication is given as to the nature of the debts. Knowledgeable PC's will be able to recognize some of the names or addresses within the book as persons or locations from the nearest large city."
8,"Advanced Human Necrosplicing: A step by step process for magically combing human beings with body parts of beasts, monsters, and magical beings. Some of the results may not be proven to be effective and most subjects will die within seconds of being combined. That's apparently not a barrier though as the magus was attempting to wed the schools of transmutation and necromancy together by creating augmenting humanoids with the physical traits of animals then raise the chimeric aberrations as particularly nasty undead."
9,"A small sketchbook with various poorly executed drawings of everyday things, places, and people. The artist made small improvements as time went on, but even the very last page isn't really that good."
10,"A book consisting of pieces of unweatherd, thick parchment, lined by a thin string of gold woven into the paper. To anyone who cannot read magic, they are always blank and featureless. However, someone who can read magical notation or cast spells, the tome contains a multitude of information of the nature of divine magical arts. Descriptions of spells that clerics, paladins druids and other casters who channel their arcane power from divine or primal sources are listed here in great detail."
11,"Four Things You Should Know About Bad People: A book that appears at first to be a thriller about three gang lords trying to outfox each other quickly evolves into a romantic comedy, as each falls in love with a complete idiot that foils their schemes unknowingly and by accident. Jumping between their perspectives, the reader learns the things that set the idiots apart from the genius criminals are matters of the heart, not the mind. The morals of the story teach the reader something fundamental about being alive, and leaves them happier and wiser."
12,"The Fey; Creatures of Endless Mischief: A simple, leather-bound book with seemingly no author; the penmanship has an odd style unlike any academic the reader has ever read or seen before. The volume is not always at the last place is was left, sometimes moving a few feet to a new location or disappearing for days at a time only to reappear somewhere incredible obvious. When it is opened, the reader goes into a dreamlike trance for 1d4 hours (Or until he is touched, yelled at or suffers damage) while he stares at the book's pages."
13,"Thus Spoke Asmodeus: A comprehensive guide to devilology, dealing with the basic principles of conjuration from the lower planes, subchapters about ritual preparation (Attire, material components, time of abstinence to ensure success), probability of survival, the ethics of human sacrifice to the dark lord, and much else.

16,"The Gauntlet: A fictional tale of a benevolent wizard who helped all those who came to him, no matter how insignificant the person or task. However, the constant frivolous and inane requests eventually started to drive him crazy. To combat this he, surrounded his tower with “The Gauntlet” to keep out all but the most determined and desperate who actually needed his help. The Gauntlet was an ever changing maze of traps, puzzles, & challenges designed to frustrate and dissuade most people by means of painful (Though nonlethal) injury, humiliating defeats or exhaustion from the ever-shifting mazes."

22,"A dog-eared copy of Man of Her Dreams, a novel by Simone Vertices, in which the heroine falls in love with a man from her own dreams and quests through the Dreamlands to bring him into reality. Halfway through, a scrap of paper serves as a bookmark; upon it is written “Meet me at the Gilded Graveyard, north entrance, midnight. Bring shovel.”"
23,"A book of historical knowledge that seems to detail an epoch approximately 2,000 years from the present and has been rather clumsily translated into Common. A handful of current powers and states are still vaguely visible in this future time but have become barely recognizable. This is either a work of artful science fiction or a translation from an authentic future history procured via time travel."
24,"Great Escapes: A book banned in prisons, jails, and places of holding as a security risk, the text is full of tales of daring and often successful prison escapes, some of them from high security prisons that were seemingly totally escape-proof. It is thought that a few copies have been smuggled into prison and are providing secret entertainment for prisoners."
25,"A Discerning Eye Regarding the Fine Arts of Gantref y Cwaelod, Gelig ap Hlannog, and Benmaenmavr; One's Studies of the Forms, One's Time Thereof, One's Difficulties and Arduous Physical Trials - A Complete Treatise: A hefty tome filled with purple prose and absolutely no art or diagrams, the text laboriously catalogues and attempts to describe fine art, music, and culture from a set of kingdoms that have literally sunken beneath the waves for hundreds of years by the time of the author. The author claims to have experienced the original works firsthand, but gives no explanation for how that was possible. Despite being titled 'A Complete Treatise', the book is maddeningly incomplete and spotty, and describes works of art that have been seen by no other living person. The author may or may not still be alive, having disappeared from the public eye some time ago."
26,"Senate Report: A plainly bound book with a rather uninteresting title, but in fact it is a secret fact-file created by the secret service of one country about 30 Politicians of another country. Compiled from both public sources and the reports of secret agents, it contains their political views, strengths, weaknesses, secret affairs and how corrupt and bribable each one is. The sort of book that would be very useful both for blackmail and for discovering the weaknesses of the listed politicians, and is the sort of book that an aspiring politician would pay a band of adventurers highly to recover, by force if need be."
27,"How To Hunt The Undead Without Getting Yourself Killed: This book has sections on all kinds of Undead, from the True Vampires and the exotic Bandage Beasts, to the metal plated Ironbones the burning issue of the Urn Beast and many more. Each section explains the strengths and weaknesses of a different kind of Undead and how to successfully kill it, or at least banish it if killing it is not physically possible. It warns against looting the Funeral Gold and Grave Silver often found with some types of Undead, as this can bring bad luck or even worse to the taker."
28,"A History of Sunreturn Customs through the Ages: A written history of the winter celebrations of various religions, it shows how people have fun at the darkest, coldest times of the year, and has plenty of suggestions for how to throw parties in tight quarters with limited resources.

31,"Slaying Dragons: A hefty tome wrapped in leather created from the skin of a black dragon, Slaying Dragons presents impassioned reasons and techniques for hunting some of the most deadly creatures in all creation. It is somewhat ironic, however, that proclaimed dragon hater and the author of this tome, one Cevinar of the Saffron Robes, died a very public death on the claws of a red wyrm some eighty years ago. Despite his untimely demise the wizard was thorough in his research, his surviving work being a testament to that."
32,"Unaussprechlichen Kulten: A book bound in heavy leather with iron hasps that contains information on cults that worship pre-human deities such as Ghatanothoa and includes hieroglyphs relating to the latter. There is also information on more recent cults including that of Bran Mak Morn, The Dark Man. It is from this work that the tale of the doomed heretic T'yog is most commonly sourced. The copy contains detailed descriptions of dark rituals and occult practices that in this day and age are considered particularly malevolent. Knowledgeable PC's can tell that the book is a fairly decent translation from the original text (The translated title is Nameless Cults), which makes the knowledge it reveals all the more nauseating. An excerpt of one of the pages reads as follows; “If one wants to use the ritual of seven desecrated graves, brought by the horrible Ikvabe, rising the six serving undead, you will need to create a wand from oak or maple. The carvings on it should be made with an iron knife soaked in the blood of a fallen woman and the sperm of a sorcerer. While placing the signs, one should chant the following: ""Fayn Eho Azarak Soh Nar Zkmelak Ole Ole Barrabas Ole Ole Hushitas”, while holding the wand of the north."

41,"Swords and Gourds: A large well folded pamphlet that was once distributed by militias amongst small farming communities to help locals better defend themselves. It outlines simple straightforward safety measures that men and women with no formal military training can use to defend their homestead or village from packs or wolves, groups of bandits or a small goblin tribe. Most of the advice boils down to creating a big show of strength and focusing on a big group armed with slings, torches and pitchforks to cause the invaders to believe that it's not worthwhile to attack, thus saving the defends from the brutalities of actual combat."
42,"The Art of the Quickdraw; How to Shoot First and Ask Questions Later: A book of battle tactics that implores the reader to focus on making the first strike in combat. The text concurs that the majority of fights a lone man or band of adventures will be involved in are small skirmishes, no more than 6-18 seconds long from the fight blow to the last. In these cases, getting your first blow in before the enemy and making it count is the difference between sleeping well that night or sleeping forever."

70,"The Necronomicon: An eerie book wrapped in a rough leather, akin to human skin. The front of the tome even has a stretched human-like face on it, warped in an expression of eternal horror. Inside its pages, are illustrations of fiendish monsters, impossible aberrations and disgusting warpings of flesh and bone. Its contents are filled with incantations, ramblings and grave warnings. While a chronicle of dark things witnessed by the author, the tome itself has a dark surprise; it's very much alive…"
71,"A small spellbook, which is little more than a collection of pages bound with willow bark. It a handful of pages are covered in rituals and notations in no known language and bearers who have it in their possession, swear it whispers from time to time, as quiet as wind rustling a willow-tree."

73,"The Tome of Strahd: A book bound in a thick leather cover with steel hinges and fastenings containing brittle parchment pages. The tome is an ancient work penned by Strahd von Zarovich, the vampiric dark lord of the valley of Barovia and is the tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state.

80,"Enchiridion of the Unusual: A book whose cover is blood red, the title in silver its only ornamentation. No gilt, no gold leaf, just simple sturdy paper bound with thread. The pages, however, are a wonder: arcane formulae and diagrams in a dozen unrecognizable languages. It is a spellbook. It is a laboratory log. It is a treatise on war machines. It is a study on dragons. And a dissertation on a dozen other unimaginable things."
81,"The Complete Draconic Lexicon: A sizable dictionary is for the Draconic language including detailed etymology, all written in flourishing script. A creature that can read Common may communicate with a creature in draconic using this book at a rate of one word per minute, even if they spoke no draconic at all."
82,"A tattered, pocket sized travel notebook, binding a collection of withered and illegible pages. A thorough investigation will reveal a single line of unmarred text near the back of the book that reads “The king has demanded eternal life, though I doubt he is willing to accept the toll of blood and earth it demands.”"
83,"The Pattern Of The Ages: An oddly compelling tome outlining a dualistic world between two warring deities. Its descriptions of magic are highly elemental and it suggests a cyclical pattern to history. It warns of thirteen powerful servants of the evil deity from a more advanced era who are sealed away and must not be released. Could this be accurate, or is it just a fantasy?"

At the time, Hermaeus had attempted to gaze deep into the heart of the Elemental Chaos, to gain wisdom and insight into the nature of the universe. Unfortunately, Hermaeus' mind quickly unraveled at the sight of the place, and though his apprentice attempted to save him, the wizard died shortly after the attempt. It's said that the text is, to the apprentice's best efforts, a copy of the exact sounds that Hermaeus produced (Though few could be realistically interpreted as spoken language of any kind), with some pictograms indicating the movements of the wizard's body as he made these sounds. Strangely, readers of this text have described odd phenomena during and after reading: text that seemed to move and shift as they read it, odd voices that could be heard up to several days after completing the reading, sudden and strange desires to do odd things such as attack a companion or develop various phobias and compulsions."
87,"Final Dawn: A small journal containing a long-forgotten cult leader's teachings on beginning and maintaining your own cult.

88,"A Mind is a Terrible thing to Waste: A tome dedicated to using the brains of intelligent creatures in various magical applications, mainly detailing Golemancy and Alchemy.

Or the mage can create a golem that acts like a feral undead, killing any living thing it comes across."
89,"The Writings Of Theon Ganderson: A small black journal kept by a man who claimed to have spotted a “thing” living under his farm house.

90,"The Koraktor: A heavy tome bound in unfamiliar leather. It describes a dark ritual that allows the sacrifice of an intelligent being to have its remaining lifespan transferred to you.

92,"The Howling: A journal bound in skin of a deer, the yellowed parchment pages contain page upon page of handwritten unintelligible script. The book is said to have been in the position of a Wendigo for several decades before coming to rest in Blackoak Restorative Manor for the Mental Infirm. The only legible content within the book is a series of signatures on the back page; believed to have been former owners of the volume. To date, every owner of the book has either died of starvation, regardless of financial means or physical health. Or has descended into the depths of animal savagery and cannibalism. Some anecdotal records at Blackoak from patient interviews suggest the book contains the last rational thoughts of all its previous owners. However, as these testimonies come from individuals who would go on to own the volume themselves or succumb to the harsh nature of their treatments; they are discredited among learned individuals."
93,"Bargains of the Underworld: A mysterious memoir whose crimson cover is unnaturally cold. It is a recording of the author's descent into madness after murdering his family and his journey into the plane of the dead to plead their forgiveness. It contains locations of planar portals, and describes ways to communicate with the dead."

The last page documents Zhelims growing fear of the darkness and voices in his head that tell him to go deeper into the ruins…"
95,"Der Abenteurer: A highly controversial exploration of power and hierarchy, heavy with economics and philosophy. The book posits that the contemporary societal structure of roving adventurers questing for artifacts, slaying everything in their path, is a degenerate state that perpetuates an unfair system of oppression. It urges monsters, brigands, and all creators of loot to rise up, move beyond boundaries of species, and present a unified front against those that wish to plunder their lairs."
96,"The Assassin's Textbook: A book filled with firsthand accounts of successful high-profile assassinations. Each entry places heavy focus on preparation and planning, and was written by the assassin who did the deed. There are numerous blank pages at the end of the book, and a note on the inside cover demands that the reader must write down their own story if they succeed in killing someone, then hide the book in a public location at night. The first several entries were written by the same person using the pen name 'Splattershrike.' Knowlegeable PC's have heard speculations that Splattershrike collects and reads any used copies of the book and makes new editions of it to include his favorite additions."
97,"A book written by Pepeq Gufgord, a necromancer of some renown entitled “Loving Return”. The binding is pale green with black lettering and an embossed cartoonish skull in the center of the cover. Inside this book is a tale in the style of a children's story about losing a loved one and how to bring them back from beyond the grave. Disturbingly the book gives a fully functional process of ritually summoning an undead with such ease that a child may perform it with little difficulty."
98,"The Convergent Truth: A ironbound book containing a detailed explanation about why the plane you are in right now is a demi-plane, an exact copy of the material plane, used to lure something called The Devourer away from the true material plane.

99,"The Material Era: A book that, starting from explaining in excruciating detail the mechanism behind spells like Dispel Magic and Antimagic Field, starts studying in what way magic can be stopped from interfering with the world, like stripping a caster from its power, creating zones of dead magic and finally showing how one could stop all magic from existing in the whole Material Plane, forever, enjoying in the hypothetical consequences of this actions."
100,"Treatise of Abyssal Lore: A large book made from the skin of hundreds of humanoid hides from across the multiverse.
