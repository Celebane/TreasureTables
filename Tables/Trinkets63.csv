When shuffled and drawn from, the Lucky 53 will always have the ace of spades at the top of the deck."

The cloth brims with divine power and knowledgeable PC's recognize it as a holy relic originating from the garments of St. Ambo & St. Ivor.

42,"A collection of scandalous, gossip-filled letters, written between two aristocratic siblings (who also seem to have been incestuous lovers) a little over a century ago. These letters repeatedly hint at the existence of some very dark secrets in the histories of several prominent local families, but are maddeningly vague about specifics. An insightful reader suspects the authors knew that their letters were being opened and read by people other than their intended recipients."

68,"A large drinking horn is bound in iron rings and covered in orcish runes."

99,"A woodcut painting of a shiver of sharks caught up in a feeding frenzy. It glows silver in starlight."
100,"A peculiar idol carved from an unknown soapy, greenish-black stone that has golden flecks. The style of the sculpture cannot be readily attributed to any known human culture, yet the idol appears to experts throughout to be unimaginably ancient. The idol inevitably evokes a sense of malevolence and revulsion in the viewer and depicts a vaguely anthropomorphic, bloated-looking creature. Its alien outlines feature an octopus-like head with antennae and tentacles, as well as a scaly, rubbery body equipped with enormous claws on its hands and feet. The form also has long slender wings. The strange form squats on a pedestal whose base is covered with illegible characters."
