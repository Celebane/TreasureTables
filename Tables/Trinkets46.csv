1,"A complete jester's outfit with brightly-colored sashes, comic shoes and bells, allowing any bearer to properly play the fool."
2,"A large, green-skinned, leathery hand suspended from a thick iron chain. The grisly item has long fingers that end in yellowed claws which flex periodically of their own accord."
3,"A three-legged stool formed from scrimshawed wyvern bones."
4,"An oil painting depicting five characters sitting around a table casually playing cards. Knowledgeable PCs recognize four of the card players as the greatest tyrants of past 500 years but the character on the far right is unfamiliar to the PCs. Extremely knowledgeable PC's will be able to determine that the amount of chips in front of each tyrant is proportional to the amount of people that villain murdered or enslaved. The unfamiliar card player has the greatest number of chips in front of them by a significant amount."
5,"A five-pound silver trade bar stamped with the royal seal of Kjarran and its value in gold (50 gold pieces)."
6,"A staff made of coral, and mounted with a spiked ebony conch that has a menacing appearance. It is occupied by a flamboyantly colored snail that occasionally pokes its head out. Placing this conch to your ear doesn't seem like a good idea."
7,"A thick leather satchel that contains items that upon initial inspection reveals what looks to be the contents of a particularly well-stocked healer's kit. However, among the various cutting implements (Varying from bone saws to scalpels), serrated pins, tongs, pliers, unguents, oils, and culture jars, there is no evidence of any materials to clean or bandage a subject after the implied surgery. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as a harvester's field kit, perfect for the swift and precise extraction of organs and other bodily materials, usually those of monstrous creatures."
8,"An ornate golden key with a black onyx gemstone in the handle. Closer inspection reveals a small skull has been carved into the gem."
9,"A decently carved, soapstone bust of the dwarven king, Odvin Hammerschlag."
10,"Acid Injector: A simple device that resembles a long funnel (Made of acid-resistant glass) with a narrow tube at one end and a large storage container at the other. It can be used to deliver a powerful acid to burn through the hinges or locks of chests, safes, and other containers, without wasting acid or damaging the contents of these containers. It takes one minute and one vial of acid to properly use the injector to apply acid to a surface. When used it to bypass a lock, hinge, or other vulnerable point on an object's surface, the precise delivery doubles the damage of the acid used. The careful nature of the injector allows the decent chance that only a minuscule amount of acid is required to do the job. Whenever the injector is used, the bearer can roll 1d6 and on a 6 the injector still contains a full vial of acid. Instead of careful use, the bearer can activate the injector as an action equivalent to attacking, which still melts the lock but carries no chance to salvage the acid."
11,"A 50-foot length of specialized Dwarven made rope known as Elfhair. Knowledgeable PC's know that while dwarves are fond of using heavy ropes whenever possible because of their durability, there are times when a thick braid of rope is impractical, especially when complex knots are involved. This narrow cable, is woven from the muscle fibers of large, subterranean insects, is as strong as a full-sized braided hemp rope and half as heavy. Dwarves call this rope elfhair as a reference to its light weight and silvery color."
12,"A beautiful lute, made from high-quality oak decorated with a silvery inlay pattern."
13,"A blackened rosewood box carved with entwining briars. Within the box is a bundle of fragile vellum documents tied together with red silk cords."
14,"A brass and copper chainmail shirt with a ring pattern far too open and loose to provide actual protection. The mail is worn over a white linen shirt and is hopefully meant to be decorative."
15,"A brass percussion instrument known as a sistrum that consists of a handle attached to a “U” shaped frame. Slender metal crosspieces are set in the frame, with tiny rings and loops attached. When shaken or twirled, the sistrum makes a staccato buzzing or clanking sound. While used in secular music, sistrums are more commonly associated with certain religions."
16,"A bronze bangle ending with two dog heads."
17,"A burlap sack containing a simple outfit that includes sandals, loose breeches and a loose shirt and is all bound together with sashes. Though it looks casual, the outfit is designed to give the wearer maximum mobility and it is made of high-quality fabric. The bearer can hide small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds and the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes."
18,"A cloak pin made from a four-inch silver disk engraved with a fox being chased by a goose."
19,"A cloth pouch containing Resolve: {Roll 3d4} gemstones each with a reddish translucency, as of sunlight seen through closed eyelids on a cloudless noon. One of them shows the first marks of a jeweler's work while the rest are uncut. Knowledgeable PC's can identify them as carnelians."
20,"A compass whose needle always points to the last person who put it down. The needle is currently spinning."
21,"An executioner's cowl consisting of a headpiece of fine black cloth that covers the bearer's upper face with a half-mask and hangs to the shoulders in the back."
22,"A crude map of the local area inscribed on a tattered canvas scroll, that bears an “X” marking an area near where the map was found. There is a list of instructions in the bottom corner of the map: Find the top of the volcano, then go south for 3-4 miles until you find the tree with a large hole in it. From there, go east for 2-3 miles, until you find the mossy limestone cliffs, then go north-east for 1-2 miles and you'll find the cask buried hidden in the shipwreck's hold. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end. The map could easily be a prank, trap, confidence scheme, ambush or the area could already have been stripped of any value by other adventurers."
23,"A pegasus-shaped silver hatpin, studded with tiny diamonds."
24,"An ebony staff, gripped with bronze embossed with a pattern of running spirals and capped by a stylized carnelian flame."
25,"A set of restraints known as Heavy Hand Manacles, designed to prevent spellcasters from casting spells, while still allowing them to use their hands for simple tasks such as eating. At a glance, heavy hand manacles look like the arms from a suit of plate mail: steel mitten gauntlets and thick sheathes for the forearm and upper arm, bound together with chains lashed across the front and back of the bearer's torso. Additional chains connect the elbows and wrists, preventing the bearer from moving his arms more than 18 inches apart. It takes one minute to properly bind a humanoid and they must be willing or helpless. A bound bearer cannot cast spells that require hand movements and automatically fail any skill checks that require dexterity of the use of their hands. The Heavy Hand Manacles are twice as difficult to escape from as typical manacles."
26,"An octagonal gold piece, with the moon and stars on one side, and a lute-strumming bard on the reverse."
27,"An orb made of a smooth, solid, five-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere."
28,"An ornate porcelain teapot painted with tranquil lake scene."
29,"A dark grey, dimpled ball with a metallic gloss that's about the size of a small apricot. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as hematite."
30,"A dramatically mounted trophy of basilisk head."
31,"A fabulous patchwork quilted coat, multi-hued and made from exquisitely cured leather from a range of beasts both mundane and exceptional, (From boars and calves to dire wolves and owlbears) with a luxurious black-and-grey fur lining and fine deep brown trim."
32,"A fist sized, polished stone with irregular concentric rings of varying shades of red that give the appearance of a fiery, inhuman eye. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as cyclops agate."
33,"A four inch long silver hairpin, tipped with a cluster of garnets shaped like flower buds and berries."
34,"A leather wallet stamped with the image of a boot on a shoe stand. It contains a full set of certified identification papers denoting that the bearer is a member of the cobblers and shoemakers guild. The section containing the member's physical description (Height, weight, sex, race, eye, skin and hair color) is completely blank and could be filled in by anyone with half decent handwriting."
35,"A framed oil painting depicting a blue dragon locked in mortal combat with a silver dragon."
36,"A large shallow bronze bowl engraved with male and female dancers."
37,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of a bountiful orchard whose trees are overflowing with fruit, the ripest of which has fallen and filled a cornucopia. The container is brimming with dozens of well preserved dried cherries."
38,"A map of the city of Erubescence, marked with mysterious circles demarcating particular buildings. If investigated in the Red City, it can be discovered that such locations are safehouses for the Nightshade Society, a secret sect devoted to ending vampiric rule."
39,"A map tattooed onto a piece of human skin, showing an island with buried pirate loot. An “X” marks a particular spot on the beachfront."
40,"A reliquary rod made of steel, two feet long and has holy scriptures carved on the outside. It's hollow and holds a relic, the radius bone of Saint Dismas. It can be used as a spellcasting focus for divine magic. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that Saint Dismas was raised to sainthood by his God, following his faithful sacrifice against a fearsome enemy. Dismas' soul was raised into an angel, while his mortal remains were fashioned into powerful reliquary artifacts."
41,"A metal flask with an embossed emblem of a large tree. It is filled with whisky of surprisingly decent quality."
42,"A military officer's signal horn, decorated with silver knotwork patterns."
43,"A monocle with circular clear crystal lens with an adamantine frame studded with six small loops on the outer rim. Colorful ribbons run through these loops to hold the monocle over one's eye quite securely, so that even mighty blows or jarring"
44,"A one gallon cask of Weatherbee's Whirler, invented by the perhaps too inventive Filbus Weatherbee, this drink is testimony as to why it is a bad idea to point a gnome's sharp mind towards the creation of a new brew. After spending many years living among the dwarves, Weatherbee made his way home with a drink even the stout folk couldn't handle. This monstrosity is laced with latent magic designed to lessen the chance of drinkers dying from its ungodly alcohol content, and reportedly tastes like “A kick in the face from a horse.” After one shot of this drink, the drinker is shunted into a chaotic haze of blurry awareness, bolstered confidence, and overpowering drunkenness. In addition, the latent magic in the brew causes minor, uncontrolled magical effects (See Note) to occur around the drinker at random times during the haze. After 1d4 hours, the haze drops away and the drinker immediately and almost violently falls into a deep sleep so that they may recover. —Note: The nature of these effects is up to either the DM who may use the Random Wild Magic Surge table as they see fit."
45,"A painting of young king and his older bride on papyrus."
46,"A pair of boards strung together on a single piece of rope. Known as clappers, this device can easily make a great deal of regular noise with little effort and are often carried by lepers (Sometimes required by law) to warn others of their presence."
47,"A pair of breeches made from the smooth, golden skin of a guardian naga."
48,"A pair of matching gold earrings, each set with a dark brown onyx."
49,"A scrollcase containing 3d6+3 sheets of finely crafted vellum. Each page is so thin as to be almost transparent, and comes in one-foot square sheets. The bearer can use these sheets to trace maps images and texts quickly. When placed over a map, book, or other writing, a sheet of this paper allows the user to trace the image with great precision. The time required for tracing varies, but it usually takes one minute for a simple image, ten minutes for an image of moderate complexity, and one hour for a complicated drawing. Tracing vellum grants advantage on forgery checks made to reproduce text, maps, or pictures. The bearer can also use a piece of charcoal to make a rubbing of uneven markings, such as the words on a gravestone or the etched runes on an altar."
50,"An elongated pear-shaped cut gem with triangular facets lends an exotic appearance to this transparent, dark green stone. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as alexandrite."
51,"An intricate wooden model of a longship housed in a large glass bottle."
52,"A pair of shining brass earrings delicately inscribed with quills, parchments, scrolls and other symbols of learning."
53,"A pair of small bongo drums, bound together by a wide, hardened leather strap, is constructed from ironwood with pebbled grey leather stretched across their heads."
54,"An intricately carved, painted wooden relief showing the struggle between the armies of Heaven and Hell."
55,"A pair of untearable fishnet stockings fit for a medium sized humanoid."
56,"A perfectly preserved pegasus feather, encased in a clear glass block."
57,"A polished oval gemstone of transparent golden yellow, deepening to brown in the center. It is about as long as a man's thumb and twice as wide at its thickest point. Knowledgeable PC's can identity it as amber."
58,"A portrait depicting an elegant vampire sitting on a decadent throne with blood flooding up from the floor."
59,"A potion vial of obsidian, capped with rock crystal and etched with a repeating pattern of feathers and scales."
60,"A red wax rosette with a small red ribbon hanging off it."
61,"A rich brown leather clamshell pouch with belt loops on one side and grommet fasteners at the edges of the top opening. It contains a set of dull steel tools suitable to the work of a locksmith, or of a burglar."
62,"A set of ten silver coins, each with a rectangular hole through the middle, threaded onto a string of golden silk."
63,"A silver bell inscribed with the teachings of Darlen."
64,"A set of thieves' tools with collapsible rods and long handles that allow the bearer to attempt to pick a lock or disable a trap from up to ten feet away. While this may allow the bearer to avoid the effects of a triggered trap (Such as a needle trap or puff of poison dust), the long-stemmed picks are rather difficult to use with the same precision as a standard set of lock picks, and the bearer always suffers disadvantage on any checks while using them."
65,"A silver hatpin, shaped like a hippogriff."
66,"A simple chain bracelet with six small coral carvings, each depicting the holy symbol of a different deity, dangling from it."
67,"A full outfit made to be worn for covert infiltration. The tightfitting, matte-black clothing includes a long-sleeved shirt, trousers with numerous pockets, soft black shoes, a black face mask and scarf that can be wrapped around the head. It also includes a cloth bandoleer that supports up to five pounds of equipment. Nonmetallic ties ensure secure attachment of items in a manner that minimizes noise."
68,"A slender rod that appears to be fabricated out of thousands of individually set feathers."
69,"A small and disturbing-looking statuette of a tentacle-faced humanoid, sculpted from a sickly purple stone that glows softly in the dark."
70,"A small bronze statuette of a boy riding a dolphin."
71,"A small dark green surcoat embroidered with white rose vines running from shoulder to hem."
72,"A small padded ceramic container known as a fire seed. This container holds a single coal from the fire the night before. A fire seed can protect an ember for up to three days, but cannot withstand immersion of any sort. Starting a fire with a fire seed is much easier than with any of the more usual methods."
73,"A small sack of dried peaches. They are well-preserved, and easily worth a handful of gold to the right aristocrat, and nearly priceless in a northern everwinter village."
74,"A small silk pouch contains a veritable menagerie of minuscule ivory figurines, each of them in the shape of some exotic animal."
75,"A gold-leaf covered candle embossed with symbols of keys, scales, and a spiral-comet."
76,"A golden bracelet whose inner band is lined with short spikes. It seems the artisan's intention was to make sure the wearer never forgets they are wearing it."
77,"A Halfing made, human sized sleeping bag known as a Hearthdown Bedroll. Made of a cloth shell of quilted wool and several plush sections along its underside for comfort, this down-stuffed bedroll is the epitome of a good night's sleep. Buttons running along one side and the top allow the person sleeping inside to close the bedroll completely if desired. In warm conditions, the roll is normally left open. On cold nights, the hearthdown bedroll earns its name, keeping the sleeper as warm as if they were resting beside a blazing hearth."
78,"An oddly-stained cloth mask with bone buttons for eyes positioned below the eye holes and ragged strips for hair and hiding the mouth so the bearer appears to have a bearded, scrunched up face with four eyes."
79,"A halfling sized set of bright ^BrightColourTable^ breeches."
80,"A small, wooden disc with painted parchment tubes attached at diametrically opposite points, the fire wheel is filled with black powder. When the powder tubes are ignited, they spew flames from one end, causing the disc to spin wildly and generate a high-pitched whistle. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that this objects are used in certain ceremonies to drive off negative influences and evil creatures that, theoretically, cannot stand the light and noise."
81,"A soft, red velvet ribbon that can be used to tie back long hair. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that these crimson ribbons are often worn by a notorious cadre of female pickpockets."
82,"A strange rock hammer with a steelmark of Abyssal runes which read “HAIL TO THE KING OF THE ROCK”"
83,"A stuffed (Real) bat on puppet strings."
84,"A tall, yellow ceramic ewer painted with a detailed scene depicting a choir of several dozen people including men, women and children of various different races."
85,"A tarnished silver bell looks like a jawless skull."
86,"A thick cloth sash painted with figures of many humanoid species in a variety of sizes, from diminutive gnomes and halflings to towering firbolgs and goliaths. It is secured with a large round buckle of polished bronze."
87,"A thumbnail sized stone of a dull brown-red hue, with an opaque glossy finish. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as carnelian."
88,"A transparent, palm sized, pale green stone has been cut into the shape of a rhombohedra. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gem as tourmaline."
89,"A violet steel tuning fork resonating on the same frequency as the Lower Planes."
90,"A veil of black silk decorated with crimson embroidery and trimmed with tiny gold drops."
91,"A wolf-shaped iron cloak clasp covered with silver leaf."
92,"A wooden box containing a dozen candles made of ^RandomColourTable^ wax. These candles cannot be put out by any means short of complete suffocation (Such as submersion) after being lit. Anything else simply puts the candle out for one round, after which it re-ignites Each candle will burn for one hour."
93,"A wooden mask, painted with a red face that has a single large golden eye in the center."
94,"A wooden relief carved from a large oak slab. It's extremely rough with dead bark still clinging to the side. The center has been masterfully engraved to depict a circle of druids gathered around a massive burning tree."
95,"A woodwind instrument known as an aulos that consists of two flute-like instruments with four fingerholes each, though the holes are drilled differently on each. The two pipes are joined near one end. The musician holds one in each hand and plays both at the same time. Only the most skilled musicians can master an aulos and is considered an instrument of professional musicians."
96,"A leather bag containing a small dragon bone is strung on a length of cord"
97,"A smooth river stone with shards of bone stuck into it. Upon detailed inspection one can determine that the bones are not of a humanoid but of a giant."
98,"A tiny charm in the shape of a rearing horse, shockingly lifelike and no larger than the first finger joint, carved from blue marble and secured in a white woolen pouch."
99,"A heavy padded bandolier with 2d4+1 small earthenware bottles that are heavy with a viscous fluid that can be felt oozing from one side to another when one moves the bottle. Each container is filled with alchemist's fire which explodes and burns when the bottle is thrown as a weapon."
100,"An ornate wooden keepsake box delicately carved with the picture of a small sloop sailing in front of a setting sun. An inset ruby in the place of the sun glows with a simmering heat."
