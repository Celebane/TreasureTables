1,"A large chain bracelet made of nine links, the metal of each of which was mined and forged from a different layer of the Nine Hells."
2,"A wooden mask that subtly changes color in unsettling vague patterns, mostly greens and purples with the occasional sickly yellow. As a viewer examines it, the mask slowly begins to reshape itself into a mold of the viewer's face, although the unsettling colors and artificiality of it remain obvious. If more than one person examines it, it begins to reshape itself into a strange conglomeration of the viewers, as if stuck in transition between the various faces."
3,"A clay-colored, oblong stone the size of an orc's fist. Holding it causes strange visions to swirl in the bearer's mind. Knowledgeable PC's can determine that the object is a petrified eye, once belonging to a prophetic cyclops."
4,"A 20 pound bundle of oil-soaked logs and flammable alchemical twigs bound to create a portable pyre. When untied and quickly rolled out over an empty 5-foot square, as an action equivalent to attacking, the bearer can choose to pull a small tab causing the materials to immediately ignite. The bearer can also choose to unroll the pyre but not ignite it, at which point it will be set ablaze by any source of sparks or fire. Creatures that enter the same square or start their turn on a lit portable pyre suffer fire damage equal to a shortsword (1d6). The portable pyre burns for ten minutes and is hot enough that a dead human placed on the pyre when it's ignited will be reduced to ash by the end. It takes ten gallons of water to extinguish the flames while its lit. It cannot be used again after being burned."
5,"A triangular electrum piece with a single lidless eye on the obverse, and a fork of lightning on the reverse."
6,"A toolkit containing numerous small pliers, files, scissors, scalpels and other items useful for harvesting small body parts from corpses. Perceptive PC's will notice subtle, sacred inscriptions etched into the case and the instruments themselves and will recognize the kit as relic retrieval tools. The painstaking process of retrieving a relic from its corpse and preparing it to be housed in a reliquary can be made somewhat simpler by using these instruments."
7,"A fine gilded dinner plate like one would find in a nobleman's dining room. On the bottom of the plate is the artisan's symbol, a stylized falcon."
8,"A rattle made from a dried gourd and holly berries."
9,"A velvet bag containing a variety of different kinds of colored glass, cut to resemble gemstones. PC's knowledgeable in the theatrical arts know that one of the simplest props that a troupe of actors often requires is one that simulates wealth. The contents of the bag accomplishes this in spades and can be handled during performances, scattered about the stage or pasted onto costumes as required. Additionally, a character can drop a real gem into the bag, shake it up and make it impossibly difficult to find. The bag contains 10d10 glass gems of various colors, sizes and cuts."
10,"A battered felt-lined box that holds a wooden orb, covered in faded paint depicting a man descending from the clouds."
11,"A battle standard with a lion embroidered in gold thread on a red field."

15,"A blood splattered war mask of beaten copper."

19,"A crude map of the local area inscribed on a tattered canvas scroll, that bears an “X” marking an area near where the map was found. There is a list of instructions in the bottom corner of the map: Find the cavern near the waterfall, then go north-west 2-3 miles, until you find the abandoned village. From there, go west 1-2 miles until you find the ancient cemetery, then go south for 3-4 miles and you'll find the prize hidden in the bole of an ancient elm tree. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end. The map could easily be a prank, trap, confidence scheme, ambush or the area could already have been stripped of any value by other adventurers."
20,"A dark green bottle filled with murky liquid. Two elves dance and cavort on the label which is labelled “Whirling Elf Absinthe”."
21,"A diamond nose stud, set in white gold."
22,"A duster made of heavy oiled canvas, the long coat reaches the bearer's ankles. Twin rows of buttons run the length of the front of the coat, and when all of them are fastened the wearer is wrapped in a nearly waterproof shell."

31,"A holy symbol of nature constructed of a thin piece of wood with four finger holes that allow the bearer to wear it over his knuckles. The smooth and polished wood supports four small claws jutting out over the bearer's fingers when worn. The symbol is decorated with feathers, beads, and etchings of animals."
32,"A huge auroch horn hollowed for use as a cup, banded with gold and etched with hunting scenes."
33,"A jet brooch carved into the shape of a raven with two glittering, translucent black diamond eyes."
34,"A landscape painting of a nearby mountain with a semi-transparent tower on top of it. A skeletal dragon perched on its roof. The frame is made from wrought iron and feels unnaturally cold."

36,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of a bountiful orchard whose trees are overflowing with fruit, the ripest of which has fallen and filled a cornucopia. The container is brimming with dozens of well-preserved dried blueberries."
37,"A leather wallet stamped with the image of a pair of explorers overlooking a wilderness. It contains a full set of certified identification papers denoting that the bearer is a member of the cartographers, surveyors, and chart-makers guild.

42,"A matching pair of small sleeping cats carved from creamy marble."
43,"A matching set of three bracelets fashioned from rare black coral."
44,"A palm sized mercenary's badge fashioned in the design of a small iron shield. Its face bears a small pearl cameo of a griffon filled with arrows. Knowledgeable PC's recognize the sigil as that of the monster hunter's guild known as “The Slayers”."
45,"A metal-shod, ten-foot pole with hinged, six-inch arms mounted every two feet along its length. Known as a descending staff, the bottom end of the item bears a sharp, iron spike, which can be used to anchor the pole into solid rock. The side arms can be extended and retracted by pulling a lever on the other end of the descending staff, providing an instant ladder wherever needed."

57,"A piece of broken pottery depicting a partial map to a ruined lakeside tower, marked with a griffon's head symbol."
58,"A piece of hollow bone skillfully carved into the shape of a humanoid tooth. This false tooth can be very useful for hiding very small objects, like tiny scraps of paper, or a thin garrote wire. It is next to impossible to notice that a creature has a false tooth in their mouth on casual inspection."
59,"A platinum pin whose thin shaft is surmounted by a bluish moonstone carved to resemble a honeysuckle flower in bloom."
60,"A sturdy quill pen made from a hippogriff feather."

70,"A sky-blue wooden box, eight inches to a side, has a tightly-fastened lid and a clockwork crank on one side which is unaccountably slimy and warm. When the crank is turned, the box produces an arrhythmic music composed of the sounds of teeth grinding, bones cracking and flesh tearing. If the crank is turned for ten seconds the 'music' reaches a sickening crescendo and the lid clacks open releasing a bundle of slimy grey rags tied around a disgusting looking grick puppet."
71,"A wooden lute of medium quality. There is a small hole in the headstock that contains a hidden stiletto dagger."
72,"A small alchemically-treated, white crystal about the size of a thumbnail. This device is designed to gauge and avoid the danger of shifting mountain weather so the bearer can seek shelter. Just before a natural storm occurs (5d10+10 minutes) the change in air pressure will cause the crystal to turn black. The object returns to being white after a 7 days of clear weather."

77,"A small, egg-shaped crystal that's warm to the touch, and regularly pulses like a gently beating heart."
78,"A striped silk handkerchief in ^BrightColourTable^ and ^DarkColourTable^. Although the design and coloring seemed to be aimed for use by a man, the cloth is infused with a woman's perfume."

90,"A wooden top painted with images of scarecrows chasing children through the forest."
