As the droplets come in contact with the cold-hearted world, they harden into Saintsblood Pearls, through which the martyr may still grant blessings to the faithful."
9,"A plain, unadorned, black obelisk three feet in height. If placed in dirt, stone or sand, directly under the open sky, a miniature storm cloud will form three feet above the obelisk and will loose a torrent of rain and a near-constant barrage of lightning on the stone. The rain evaporates immediately and cannot be drank or collected and the lighting is equivalent to harmless static shocks."
10,"Adversarial Melody: A black and red music box that upon casual use, appears to be broken. When cranked, the ballerina in the box twirls around but only one creature in all of existence can hear it. Whoever considers themselves the bearer's worst enemy can hear a faint, disembodied nursery rhyme. The bearer is not necessarily aware of this phenomenon."

When the jar is opened, they fly out, but stay in a line formation as if tired together with a small, invisible string.

27,"A large brass candelabra that will only allow the candles to stay lit for an hour at a time, no matter their size. They can be re-lit at any point after the candelabra snuffs them out.

28,"A bejeweled ivory drinking horn with gold filigree"
29,"A permanently boogery nose ring of orcish design that was worn by a revered historian for the majority of his life. While worn, the bearer becomes familiar with all aspects of orcish life.

The tome is blank, but when a story is told by someone holding it open, illusionary imagery appears hovering above the book, acting out what the storyteller describes. In the hands of a skill orator, the illusions can serve as an impressive visual aid, acting out each loving described detail, heart wrenching emotional cue and choreographed fight scene. The book can also create terribly misshapen wretches whose very existence offends the nature of any creature with measurable visual acuity when in the hands of a terrible narrator. In addition, when a story puts a creature to sleep, the storyteller may allow the book to display and act out the sleeper's dreams, which usually tie in to the story that was being told."

72,"A heavy glass bottle containing a viscous black fluid labeled “Blackfire Breath”. This alcoholic “drink” is 95% pure grain alcohol and the other 5% is the maker's secret ingredient which compounds the effectiveness of the liquor tenfold. A single shot of this “beverage” is enough to place an adult man of particularly strong constitution in need of a cleric for healing and a normal man in need of a cleric for funeral rites. Extremely knowledgeably PC's will know that the secret ingredient is the result of a complex distillation process, which uses the glands responsible for producing the potent acid of a black dragon's breath weapon as its raw material."

93,"A bundle of good quality tiger pelts tied together with leather strips and wrapped in oilskin"

95,"Token of the Brash: A heavy gold coin from an unfamiliar civilization, depicting a harsh looking bearded man on one side and an odd coat of arms on the other. When on their person, the bearer will become harsh and uncouth in any conversation they participate in. They speak any rude thoughts that come to mind and will feel no remorse for their words as long as it's kept on their person. The effect is noticeable to the bearer as well as any who listen to him. The effect ceases as soon as the coin is removed from the creature's person or placed in a lead lined box."

When on their person, the bearer will become unceasingly happy. They will joke and make happy small talk to anyone that so much as looks their direction as long as the coin is kept on their person. The effect is noticeable to the bearer as well as any who listen to them. The effect ceases as soon as the coin is removed from the creature's person or placed in a lead lined box."
97,"A sleep mask made of a deep green silk. When worn, the bearer has dreams of a sexual nature about the last person they spoke to."
98,"A plain looking copper coin with a small etching of a fish hidden among its other marking.

It reverts back to being a coin if if goes without touching any other coins for one hour."
99,"A brown leather bandolier holding seven silver bells with mahogany handles. The bandolier is custom made to keep the bells firmly in place, with internal flaps which keep the clappers from moving. The bells vary in size, starting with one the size of a small pill bottle and growing larger, till the seventh is almost the size of a jar. The wood and metal of the bells are etched with an ancient array of necromantic sigils known as Charter Marks. Knowledgeable PC's will remember a set of stories involving an order of benevolent necromancers known as Abhorsen whose charge was to maintain the border between life and death. It was said that they channeled their magic though a set of bells, that when properly used by one powerful enough could grant the ringer complete master over life and death. It was also said that a single accidental note from the wrong bell could kill the wielder and everyone else within earshot. Either way these bells are either masterful reproductions of old stories or their magic has long since departed, as ringing the bells causes nothing but reminding the listener of their own mortality."
100,"Love's Labour's Lost: A fairly plain looking gold coin with the head of a hansom male human on one side and a gorgeous female human on the other. The soft gold is somehow always completely free of scratches, dirt or grime no matter it's treatment. Knowledgeable PC's capable of identifying magical items, will be able to determine that the coin is actually a set of memories and emotions solidified into physical form by magic. A particularly perceptive PC using a powerful magnifying glass will notice that the rough, uneven edge of the coin is actually a series of storyboards scenes. The pictures describe the owner's first meeting with his love and all their experiences both violent and loving, joyous and sorrowful up until the last time he saw her and was forced to leave her behind, knowing that she wouldn't be able to wait for him. At the break where the storyboard ends and begins again is the figure eight symbol of infinity with a “V” in one circle and a “D” in the other. It's likely that the owner's grief drove him to have his feelings and memories of her forcibly removed so he would no longer hurt inside. However the owner was too sentimental to simply throw his feelings away and carries his love with him wherever he goes. Unbeknownst to the owner, the experiences can be returned to his mind simply by placing the coin in his mouth which causes the gold to dissolve and the memories to return in a rushing torrent of love and loss. The magic of the coin compels the owner to keep it in his possession and instill the feeling that the item is somehow important. The coin's owner would rather die than lose it and would not doubt be extremely grateful for it's safe return."
