1,"heavy copper coin on which the face on the coin has been carved into an elegant skull. Knowledgeable PC's will be able to recognize the mark as the symbol of a local thieves guild and can find a saying in thieves cant carved around the edge of the coin."
2,"Genevieve's: A small tin canister containing a few dozen candies that (According to the labelling), were accidentally synthesized by the gnomish alchemist Genevieve Boghopper. They're big lumpy balls that rapidly change colors, each representing a different flavor, until they come into contact with saliva. The instructions mention that trying to put it in your mouth at the right moment to get your favorite flavor is a challenge and fun game."
3,"A worn but well-polished, silver inlaid gavel."
4,"A complex abacus made with snail shells."
5,"A long-stem pipe made of bone, carved to look like a devil."
6,"A palm-sized mechanical crab that looks more like a tin can with metal legs and claws attached to it. Winding up this device causes it to skitter and jump about snapping its claws until it falls over. Apart from amusing small children, the item doesn't seem to have any practical use."
7,"A bracelet of halfing design, carved from a single moss agate."
8,"A metal cylinder that smells at all times of burnished copper and a slight whiff of sulfur. When shaken, a rattling noise  emanates from inside of it."
9,"A slim wand that leaves a trail of faint sparkles behind as it moves through the air when being used as a focus for casting magical spells."
10,"Stone Sleeve: A stone sleeve is little more than a narrow cloth tube that is tied to the inner forearm so the opening rests in the palm. The sleeve can then be filled with up to six good-sized throwing stones or sling bullets. The sleeve can be opened with ease, allowing the bearer to arm himself with one of the rocks stored within as a free action."
11,"A small sapphire ear cuff carved in the shape of a creature's fang"
12,"Song Collar: A set of iron tubes designed to aid traveling musicians in learning new or complex compositions for the lute, violin, or another similar stringed instrument. Built to fit snugly over a normal quarterstaff, this item consists of a long metal collar that slips down over the top half of the staff, roughly two feet long for a typical staff. The metal's surface is covered with rows of small, dimpled indentations, ostensibly to provide a better grip on the staff. In reality, these indentations correspond with the fingering for a piece of music to be played on a preferred instrument of the owner. Song collars crafted gnome engineers as training tools for journeymen, enabling them to practice chords and notes while traveling without attracting attention. A creature can actively learn or practice an instrument while traveling and maintaining a normal walking pace. While practicing on the move, the bearer suffers disadvantage on perception checks and is only considered to be practicing half as quickly as normal. For example a PC attempting to learn ho to play the lute who trains while walking for eight hours is only considered to have practiced for four hours towards becoming proficient in the instrument."
13,"A knight's banner consisting of a vertical black rectangle with a black rook eclipsing a white sun on a field of black and purple."
14,"A cut and polished piece of glass that could almost pass for an actual gemstone."
15,"A dwarven brass puzzle cube with runes on it. Numerous rectangular pieces are interwoven with each other, and need to be moved in a particular order to take it apart. After completing the many puzzles require to take the object apart, the bearer can see that the core is just a small sphere with the words “So you think you're smart do you? Shove off!” written on it."
16,"An acorn with little green sprouts that retreat back into the nut when exposed to sunlight."
17,"A stein decorated with a design depicting a fearsome kraken tearing a ship apart during a tumultuous sea voyage. Golden threads decorate the bottom of the design and line the polished metal lid of the stein."
18,"A little toy wagon with a coffin, drawn by skeletal horses. As the wheels turn a scratching sound can be heard from inside the coffin."
19,"A mirror that shows the reflection of the viewer as if they were the opposite gender."
20,"An ivory flute mouthpiece, noticeably lacking in the rest of the instrument. When held to the mouth, the rest of the flute coalesces. Its ghostly blue form is semisolid and always produces sweet but strangely sad notes."
21,"A simply painted, wooden jester's mask with an unsettling smile carved in. The eyes show the same glee that a child shows as they burn ants with a piece of glass, not fully grasping the value of life. This mask  mildly compels to bearer to tell jokes, pull pranks and play tricks, although cruel and twisted ones more often than not."
22,"A smallish oaken strongchest, bound in bronze. Inside it rests four fat, tightly-packed pouches of waxed linen filled with a brilliant scarlet dyestuff and three dried bundles of the ruddy, weedy herb of unknown type the dye was rendered from. One bundle is tied with a crude map to the source of the herb."
23,"A hollow, seamless, clear quarts cube with unknown beasts carved in negative into the inside."
24,"An ocarina made out of a large beetle exoskeleton. When played, the sound is not dissimilar to a cricket's chirp."

26,"A stein made of silver and ivory depicting a scene of a picturesque dwarven mountain village."
27,"A mechanical puzzle made of a blue crystal surrounded by an intricate pattern of pieces of wood, inscribed with strange symbols and fastened together with black cord. The crystal contains a number of interlocking pieces, which can be carefully taken apart and maneuvered through the cords and wood."
28,"A a squat, round bottle with the bottom half wrapped in twine containing a rare distilled spirit from desert regions known as Aleaqrab. More commonly referred to as Scorpion Whiskey, the liquid is a dark, rusty brown, and is similar in viscosity to maple syrup, though it's not nearly as sticky. The thickener is hidden at the bottom of the bottle: a scorpion tail, severed from a living creature. The tail is removed and immediately dropped into a full bottle of barley spirit; the mixture of blood and venom give the drink its trademark color and flavor, along with an unusual extra kick. Aleaqrab is traditionally drunk as a shot. It smells metallic and vaguely briny. It has a strong copper flavor with notes of honey, and a piquant burn closer to a hot pepper than regular alcohol. Drinkers of weak weak constitutions often find that the scorpion venom causes their mouth and tongue to go numb for hours after taking even a single shot."
29,"A broken crow skull. The missing pieces of the skull have been replaced with carved, polished and smooth green crystal."
30,"A finely crafted silver hand mirror. Whomever looks into the mirror will see an idealized version of the person they are currently thinking of."
31,"A monocle that when looked through shows a brief memory of the wearers biggest regret."
32,"A paper with an illustration of a beautiful woman with ink hearts around it and the name of a city. On the back is a love poem dedicated to the woman. A well read PC will recognize the woman as a purely fictional character from a romance novel."
33,"A handheld sounding post-horn. The instrument has detailed, graphic engravings of humanoids being torn asunder by sword and axe. A single blow of this horn will surely strike fear in any tribe or group that has the misfortune of being a target for conquest."
34,"A scrap of parchment with detailed drawing of a demonic ritual circle"
35,"A shuttered bullseye lantern shaped like a screaming mouth. It contains a stubby black candle that burns far slower that should be possible."
36,"A small figurine made of soapstone carved into the shape of a snail wearing a saddle."
37,"A plush doll of a male human wearing hunting clothing, a crossbow and a sword. There's a slit on the doll's back allowing it to be turned inside out, turning him into a black dire wolf. Both only have one eye."
38,"An onyx carved into a small coin. The obverse sigil is a simple flat line denoting the void. The reverse a phrase in common that reads “No barrier will hold back my anger.”"
39,"A wooden hand cranked coffin shaped box that, when opened, reveals a set of domino tiles made of grey bones."
40,"A satchel containing a cloth measuring tape, a hammer, saw, shovel, and a small box of nails. All of the objects, including the satchel are sized for a small child to use and a perceptive PC can find stitching on the interior of the satchel that reads “My Little Undertaker”."
41,"A set of panpipes fashioned from a tree struck by lightning."
42,"A sturdy leather wallet branded with the symbol of a pair of spears crossing over a shield. It contains a full set of certified identification papers denoting that the bearer is a corporal with a good service record in a well respected mercenary company. The section containing the member's physical description (Height, weight, sex, race, eye, skin and hair colour) is completely blank and could be filled in by anyone with half decent handwriting."
43,"A rose-cut golden opal wrapped carefully in twine."
44,"A clockwork depiction of a hag stirring a cauldron with two withered cloth arms. As the stirrer is cranked, a haunting tune plays. As the tune crescendos, a scream is heard and a child's head pops out of the cauldron. To reset the toy, the child's head must be pushed back into the cauldron."
45,"A talisman carved from jet, in the shape of a panther's claw."
46,"A waterproof scrollcase filled with parchments covered in artificer's diagrams for various inventions, mainly those relating to what looks like attempts to create flying machines. The case contains a fair bit of sawdust, metal shavings and other evidence that the arcane engineer may have already started construction."
47,"A glass skull wrapped in taut, tanned humanoid leather."
48,"A bone smoking pipe. Its stem is too short for the smoking of poppy-seed and the bowl is too small for any substantial amount of tobacco."
49,"An artificial hand carved of bogwood with silver inlays indicating the location of every bone in the wrist, palm, and fingers; all labeled in a looping, unknown script."
50,"A perfectly preserved human heart, encased in a clear glass cube."
51,"A box compass, hard leather, scuffed, and no larger than a snuffbox. Reveals a sphere struck through by a red needle, suspended in a crystal ball filled with clear liquid. The needle points north, even if rotated in three dimensions."
52,"A cast iron fly, large as a chicken's egg. The legs are bent, and a wing is missing. Tucked between the legs is the remnant of a mounting track, the kind used to attach ornaments to connection pins on metal armor."
53,"A cloisonné dreidel. Each face, gold-leafed lead set with colored garnets, depicts a geometric face, each bearing a different expression: Bare-toothed anger, sneering disgust, white-eyed fear, and twisted, wretched misery."
54,"The Pipe Pipe: A smoking pipe that doubles as a musical pipe. If the bearer smokes and plays the instrument at the same time, he can magically control the shape of the smoke, creating small billowing forms."
55,"A copper cicada tarnished blue-green. Large enough to fill the palm. The hump of its thorax is set with a large malachite cabochon. Some examination reveals said cabochon is a button. Its mechanism, though somewhat stuck with age, causes the cicada's wings to lift, revealing a small, oblong storage space in the abdomen. The wings must be reset manually. They click into place, locked tight."
56,"A fragment of bone, obviously the concave top plate of a human cranium, edged with pitted gold. Three inches wide and carved on the inside with cramped script. A reader adept in Abyssal will discern an outdated version of a prayer to the Dark Lord of Random Evil Domain carved within."
57,"A heavy glass heart that is perfectly to scale with a human heart. The object is crafted of dark, smoky glass and has a hole for dipping in the gaping atrium that is filled with the gummy remnants of old, reddish resin, perhaps ink."
58,"A flute, tuned to an odd key, made from bone of an unknown creature."
59,"A red brass sphere, slightly pitted. It rings dully when shaken and feels as though some thick liquid or sand shifts inside. If shaken vigorously, it becomes chillingly cold. A shallow mark has been stamped on one side: A long triangle, perhaps a tooth or an icicle."
60,"A hairwork needlepoint displayed under a cabochon of greenish glass. Mounted on a nickel silver brooch. The needlepoint depicts, in black and blond, presumably-human, hair, a smiling black skeleton beckoning to a quizzical, robed child."
61,"A set of gray and red robes with threadwork made to resemble teeth and mouths around all of the openings. The sleeves and wristcuffs always stretch until they extend past the bearer's hands making it seem like objects he holds are being eaten and swallowed."
62,"A head-sized dodecahedron; bronze and blackened. Each of the twelve sides has a wide hole in its center. Visible through the holes is the indistinct form of a lead-dipped skull, evidently entrapped there when the hedron was forged."
63,"A lensed brass tube, like a spyglass, but not collapsible. Anyone who peeks through its cracked and dusty lens sees the world upside down and in faded, red-monochrome negative."
64,"A lock of human hair preserved in a cylinder of yellowing resin capped by false-gold ends. The lock is purple black, a color rarely seen these days, in humans."
65,"A defaced iron insignia shaped like a shield. Someone has taken a sharp knife point and defaced the thing with a rough X symbol, then crushed it flat. Under the X, the shape of a crudely molded fir cone barely shows."
66,"A smoked glass mask bearing a serious expression. Its eye sockets are straight and focused. A nine pointed star is carved into the forehead and the lips of the mask are covered in a thick layer of glossy black lacquer."
67,"A needle file, steel, a foot long, and slightly dull at the point. The file itself is unexceptional, save some rust, but the handle is long and fashioned like a bone. A very human bone, recognizable by the knobbly epiphysis of a femur at its end."
68,"An ivory playing piece shaped like the bust of a muscled, eyeless man with interlocked fingers and palms rested atop the pummel of some weapon haft. He is eyeless, for the metal dome of a lead skullcap covers his ears, nose and eyes. Only thin lips show below."
69,"A leather mask that covers the face above the upper lip. The fangs of a vampire are set into the mask, so that they almost seem to be the wearer's own teeth."
70,"A small clay bust of a bald woman with instructions to dampen the head daily. If the instructions are followed, after 1d4 days the head begins to sprout long fine vines of poison ivy"
71,"A pewter acorn with a lead cap and stem. Something sloshes heavily inside, like mercury. The cap does not open."
72,"A pitted fist of ore, quite heavy, that contains strange fossils. Neither the bony, many-legged fossils nor the metal within the ore are readily identifiable as any known to alchemical sciences or arcane arts."
73,"A dollhouse in which the beautiful family rooms conceal secret rooms tunnels and cellars. Each hidden room contains a scene of torture or murder."
74,"A single earring of an ugly style. A thick, short hoop of reddish, soft metal. It smells faintly of wet iron or raw offal when touched and seems to make the fingers sticky. It attracts insects, large ones, that sit within the loop, when worn, and worry and wash their hairy legs, buzzing lowly in the wearer's ear."
75,"A skeleton doll, articulated. It's blackened ivory bones, rather detailed, are joined by small iron rings. One arm is missing, and one eye socket is filled with a small garnet. If carefully inspected, it becomes evident there are two more rows of teeth than normal in the jaw."
76,"A small show globe, akin to the large sort hung in an alchemists' shops, capped and banded with blackened silver. The screw cap is stuck on but might yield with some twisting. Contains bright blue powder, so fine that a single breath might send it all blowing away."
77,"A small silver spoon. Long, with two slots in its bowl. Any food it contacts develops an acidic flavor; savory, but not pleasant to a modern palette. Any water does so, too, and turns a greasy grey."
78,"A steel-bristle brush, round and palm-sized. The ferule and handle are rusted iron, but the bristles maintain a stainless shine. If the rust is scraped away, the mark of an obscure, two-crested helmet may be seen stamped atop the grip."
79,"A hastella, six inches tall, made of fragile wood. Defaced with profane graffiti deeply scored with a pointed knife. The rude letters belong to a language now forgotten. They have since been filled with some silvery metal, and their edges now rise higher than the worn-down wood."
80,"Half of a broken mask of brittle iron. An impassive, large-eyed face shows on the front, genderless. Within, the mask is not smooth, but convoluted by the canals, chambers, and processes of the facial skeleton, as if this shattered mask once composed the front portion of a living skull."
81,"A set of cloth pennants on a tall staff. When the wind blows them, the long flags of dark blues and blacks speckled with silver spots, resemble nothing more than a banner of the night sky."
82,"A bronze and beech incense burner set with several cinnabars."
83,"A copper mask, with the image of a skeleton and set with a moonstone. It is of marvelous workmanship."
84,"A workaday leather tunic that draws closed at the neck with antler toggles. The long tunic is slit at the sides to mid-thigh for free movement."
85,"A pair of leather shoulder pads adorned with the horns of a fallen minotaur."
86,"A surrealistic painting of an irresponsible sage with the head of a manta ray, dismembering an owl with whiskers like a cat in a dense jungle."
87,"A pecan wand with a floating bauble made of peridot at the tip"
88,"A forked darkwood wand with a tip of beech, ending in an image of a woman's face, with real alchemically preserved, shrunken eyes."
89,"A small wooden box containing a coarse parchment scroll. It is wound around two thick dowels, and bears densely packed writing, smeared ink, and smells strongly of cedar."
90,"A mask resembling a giant locust head, recreated in remarkable detail. A close look reveals that it was created using the exoskeletons and body parts of millions of other bugs. When worn, insects, bugs, spiders, roaches, and any other creepy crawlies emerge seem to ignore the bearer and do not bite or bother him unless deliberately provoked."
91,"A merchant's black silk brocade jerkin, cut in the elven fashion, clinging closely to the figure with skirts draping almost to the knee. The jerkin is embroidered all over with tiny, precise, golden sunbursts."
92,"A bundle of unmarred seal pelts tied together with sinew and wrapped in a protective oilskin case."
93,"A thick iron ring with eight chains attached. Each quarter-meter chain, composed of nine links, has a short spine protruding on either side of each link. Investigation shows that the large, central ring, which has a spike on one end, has a broken nub opposite it, where the whole affair might have been attached to a haft."
94,"A small, Randomly Coloured lizard with brightly scintillating scales that's been perfectly preserved and  entombed in a rectangular block of clear glass."
95,"A tiny bronze kettle, or perhaps a retort, dark with tarnish. It has a curling chimney, rather than a spout. When liquid is heated inside, it immediately evaporates."
96,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of a bountiful orchard whose trees are overflowing with fruit, the ripest of which has fallen and filled a cornucopia. The container is brimming with dozens of well preserved, dried cranberries."
97,"A mountain dulcimer made of black locust wood. The sound-holes are intricately carved in the shape of stars. It re-tunes itself on clear nights."
98,"A crude map of the local area inscribed on a tattered canvas scroll, that bears an “X” marking an area near where the map was found. There is a list of instructions in the bottom corner of the map: Find the canyon with natural stairs leading down, then go south-west for 3-4 miles until you find the old king's forest. From there, go east for 2-3 miles, until you find the elder tree, then go south-east for 1-2 miles and find the largest crypt in the cemetery and you'll find the reliquary protected by a necromantic curse. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end. The map could easily be a prank, trap, confidence scheme, ambush or the area could already have been stripped of any value by other adventurers."
99,"A steel measuring chain. Identifiable as a measuring instrument, as each two-centimeter link is labeled with a careful line and a unit in its end. The units appear to be standard numbers, but with some odd, serif-like additions to each. 110 links, in total."
100,"A worn letter closed with blood red wax wax and sealed with an stress inducing symbol in the shape of a down turned  crescent marked with a few inward-facing spikes. Breaking the seal and reading the contents reveals a letter from an unknown author to their unnamed relative begging for their aid during a time of dire need. The pleading note reads as follows: “Ruin has come to our family. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor. I lived all my years in that ancient rumor shadowed manor, fattened by decadence and luxury, and yet I began to tire of… conventional extravagance. Singular unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on… swarthy workmen and… sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness. In the end, I alone fled, laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity. Until consciousness failed me. You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you, return home, claim your birthright and deliver our family from the ravenous clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon.”"
