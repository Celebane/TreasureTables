1,"A shining longsword bearing a dragon on each side of the blade with a gap at the mouth that spouts illusionary fire down the length of the sword. The symbol of two crossed warhammers is etched into the hilt and the pommel bears a large, pure red ruby."
2,"A large snakeskin quiver containing a dozen javelins, each made from ironwood and intricately carved to look like a cobra."
3,"A longbow made out of an ancient, seemingly waterlogged wood. A deep-blue, glassy orb the size of an eye is embedded in the wood and the wielder can catch the scent of fresh ocean air whenever the bow is fired."
4,"A warhammer that fills its wielder with confidence, leaving them “Fairly certain” that they can somehow solve all problems they encounter as long as they swing the hammer hard enough. If the weapon is carried regularly, the wielder will find themselves uttering the catchphrase “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”. The confidence and the verbal tic go away the moment the warhammer isn't carried."
5,"A simple mace comprised of a solid blunt head attached to a haft. The grip of the weapon bears the etched holy symbol of a God of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ that has been crudely defaced."
6,A rapier with a guard formed of ornately sculpted tentacles that wrap around and protect the grip. The blade is covered with detailed engravings of suffering and madness. The weapon was forged by the ancient aberrant servants of a Great Old One and appears to be in motion when viewed from the corner of one's eye.
7,"A leather bandolier filled with a dozen, finely honed, steel throwing knives that are perfectly balanced for juggling, throwing and general sleight of hand or performance tricks."
8,A longsword consisting of a broken blade attached to a green hilt. The hilt has two handles in the design of a twisted dragon which has three spikes on its head and on its back. The longer handle has the dragon's head at the end while the shorter handle has what appears to be a claw. The sword was once of masterwork quality and still functions relatively well as a weapon despite only half of the blade remaining and can be wielded as a shortsword without issue.
9,A black glaive forged from meteoric metal that dimly glows with corrupted starlight. When wielded in combat the bearer develops the urge to drink the blood of their foes.
10,"A spiked shield consisting of a large humanoid skull (Roughly three times the size of an adult human's skull) in the center, surrounded by several smaller skulls and a dozen spikes which protrude at all angles. Smaller spikes also jut out from various orifices in the central skull and the entire object has been enchanted with protective magics making it as strong and durable as iron. The skulls all face towards the wielder's enemies, with the bony spikes erupting through their wide open jaws and empty eye sockets."
11,A primitive maul with a gnarled shaft of twisted arête pine and a head of mountain rock.
12,"A specialized dagger defined by an H-shaped horizontal hand grip which results in the blade sitting above the wielder's knuckles. This type of push dagger is commonly known as a katar and allows the wielder to put all of their punching force behind the strike, which deals piercing damage."
13,A beautiful leaf-bladed shortsword with an elegant golden handle and a slight blue tinge to the metal's sheen. A large flawless sapphire is set in the sword's hilt and runic glyphs run down the center of the blade. These glyphs are written in a cipher and may contain tales of future exploits of the current wielder or tales of the heroes who once bore this blade. The glyphs will shift after a few weeks and they always change when a new bearer attunes to the blade.
14,"A fearsome maul forged to resemble two separate skull like faces, with burning eyes and snake's fangs."
15,"The ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ is chipped, cracked, rusty or rotted and it's a wonder the thing doesn't fall apart when someone gives it a stern look, but it performs just as well as any other weapon of its type."
16,"A small dagger-like blade (Dagger statistics, that deals half damage) that can be woven into the end of a long braid of hair and spun around to function as a concealed weapon. The bearer must have hair long enough (Typically 1-2 feet) to braid the weapon into and provide enough length to actually swing it around. Despite its shortcomings as an offensive option, the blade can be used while the hands are otherwise occupied and while worn, the bearer has advantage on rolls made to hide it on their person. In order to properly use this uncommon weapon, the wielder must have practiced with it for at least two hours in the past week. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that these weapons are known as braid blades in some assassination and wetwork circles and are often routinely poisoned and worn in long hair, hidden along with other ornamentation as a last resort. —Note: Braid blades are usually painted in natural hair colours and intelligent bearer's will paint or colour the weapon to have the same colour and tone as their hair."
17,"The ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ is dominated by a mysterious crest or sigil which no-one can identify."
18,A slate grey mace that leaves ashy marks on everything it strikes.
19,"A greataxe consisting of a black iron haft four feet in length, wrapped in leather, which always feels slightly warmer that it should. The weapon is capped with a massive, double-bladed axe head that glows with golden light."
20,A pair of single-edged handaxes with spikes opposite their blades. Their smooth wooden hafts are decorated by grips of banded steel and the butts of the hafts are capped with barbed steel spikes.
21,A slim quiver made of dark brown leather with silver runic patterns along it and having a rimming of silver. The quiver houses 20 similarly decorated arrows and the sum total is a lovely piece of craftsmanship by any reckoning.
22,"A katana with a delicate wooden handle, sanded and smoothed until the blackened wood is like silk upon the hands, and wrapped in the finest dark chain and silks so the grip of a wielder might never slip. The flowing hand guard is forged of thin interlacing black steel to create a latticework many times stronger than a single hammered out piece. The folded steel blade leaves trails of black smoke filled with violent whispers in the wake of every swing."
23,"A pale pine quarterstaff with silver bands, capped by a large, spherical moonstone. The staff resonates with magical energy when held by a good creature capable of casting magical spells."
24,"A recurve bow (Composite Bow statistics) with a grinning, horned skull of an imp mounted on the front of the bow's grip. Arrows shot through the skull's mouth burst with short lived, illusionary black fire the moment they pass the imp's fanged teeth."
25,A steel saber (Shortsword or longsword statistics) with a cup hilt and a well-balanced blade that has intricate whirl patterns engraved on it. The weapon's brass pommel is wrapped in sharkskin stamped with the dwarven rune for the number six.
26,"A large iron warhammer, wrought in traditional dwarven style, yet made to fit the hands of larger beings. It has an octagonal iron handle banded with silver."
27,"A sentence in a now extinct language runs along the length of the ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^. Although untranslatable by normal means, a wise and learned sage who has spent his life studying ancient languages may be able to decipher it. Powerful divination magic may also be of use, however the language is illegible by simple comprehension or translating type spells. —Note: The sentence can be anything the DM wishes and I recommend the process of finding something or someone to translate the text a side quest in itself. The words could represent written directions to a treasure hoard, the truename of a spirit, demon or angel and instructions for a summoning and binding ritual, a command phrase to activate the weapon's hidden magic or simply just the family motto of the creature that crafted it."
28,"A one-handed stone club sporting a jagged edge on one side, with sharp edges that look like human teeth. On close examination, it looks like nothing so much as half of a jaw. The weapon feels smooth, as though made of jade, but looks like bleached human bone and is always cold to the touch. The bearer always feel more self-assured while wielding the club, as though nothing bad could ever befall him."
29,"A longsword with a highly sharpened blade that glows a pale sickly green light when unsheathed. The sword is light, long, and slim, has a small green emerald embedded in the center of the hilt and no crossguard. The grip of the weapon is fit only for single handed use and sports a bell-guard to cover the hand."
30,"A long whip with a multi ended iron-barbed tip, that resembles a miniature grappling hook. The wielder can forgo an attack with this weapon and instead attempt to use it to disarm an opponent within reach. The wielder then makes a strength or dexterity check (Wielder's choice) which is compared against the target's strength or dexterity check (Target's choice). Should the wielder be successful, the weapon is pulled from the target's grasp and lands in the wielder's free hand or at his feet. The specialized hook is made for disarming rather than inflicting pain and the whip deals half normal damage. —Note: If your game system already allows a wielder to do this with a whip, they instead gain advantage on the relevant ability checks."
31,"A well-crafted longbow that's longer on the top than the bottom, so an archer could comfortably shoot whilst kneeling. The bowstring is taut and the wood strong, making the bow less likely to break but harder to pull."
32,"A pair of thick leather gloves made from rough sharkskin. Numerous large shark's teeth are embedded in the backs of the gauntlets so that when the bearer makes a fist, the teeth splay outward from the knuckles. The gloves are waterproof and are treated as spiked gauntlets for the purposes of attacks made with them."
33,"A ghastly longbow, carved from an almost writhing black wood, with tendrils extending into it's bowstring."
34,"A lovingly crafted sickle with a carved walnut handle, darkened through decades of use."
35,"A heavy mace fashioned out of a bright, mahogany wood. The weapon's rich color is matched by its octahedral head and ornate carvings all along its shaft. Half of each face of the octahedral head is painted with checkered patterns, such that the pattern alternates with the remaining, undecorated parts of the head."
36,A beautifully crafted heavy crossbow with dwarven runes inscribed across its immaculately polished brass and nickel fittings.
37,A battleaxe with script written in a rough tongue going up its grey blade and a handle wrapped in dragonskin.
38,A war scythe set with a dark blade with rippling patterns in the metal and a handle fashioned to look like four figures in agony. Those who hold the weapon experience the unsettling feeling that it was once used to steal souls.
39,An oversized recurve composite bow reinforced with manticore horn and strung with sinew from dire beasts.
40,"A two-handed maul with a shaft of polished mahogany,and a heavy iron head. The emblem of a stylized silver hand rests in a bed of gold design on either side of the weapon's head. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as the symbol of the Knights of the Silver Hand, an order of paladins and holy warriors devoted to vanquishing evil and protecting the innocent."
41,"A modified heavy crossbow known as a net launcher that can fire a weighted net twice as far as it's normal effective range. The weapon cannot fire crossbow bolts and in order to properly use this uncommon weapon, the wielder must already be proficient with heavy crossbows and have practiced with it for at least one hour in the past week."
42,"A large stone maul with Dwarven runes engraved on its handle with a thin blue wrap acting as a grip. Though the hammer is hundreds of years old, it is barely chipped and bears few cracks, making it a true testament to dwarf craftsmanship and the strength of stone."
43,"A pair of sleek shortspears, both with spearheads forged in a tight spiraling design."
44,"A strange wrought iron longbow with a protruding barb at the grip, accompanied by a small flat iron token. The sturdy metal bow somehow bends and pulls just as easily as a typical one."
45,"A strange, long handled battleaxe made from tiny metal tubes, all twisted about each other. At one end there is a scored grip, at the other there is a flat piece of metal, pierced with small holes, a long, thin hook curving out from it. The grip bears a silver maker's mark contrasting starkly against the dark metal."
46,"A well crafted bastard sword with a wide blade. The grip has a dark swirly appearance to it, giving the appearance of a cosmic void. The crossguard has a hollow center and a sharp diamond shape with pointed edges that matches its pommel. The rain guard is adorned with jewels, that emanate with regality."
47,"A cedar quarterstaff bound in steel, capped by a fist-sized garnet. The staff resonates with magical energy when held by a neutral creature capable of casting magical spells."
48,"A spiraled, footman's lance (Longspear statistics) with a small spur on the end of the pommel that balances out the weapon's weight."
49,"A katana of excellent design, it's dark metal folded upon itself during its craftsmanship. It bears an ornate bronze guard and the handle sports an elaborate braided design. The scabbard is dark lacquered wood, with a yellow ribbon, used to tie itself to the wielder's waist."
50,"A slim tube known as a wrist launcher, designed to be concealed beneath the sleeve by strapping to one's forearm. It allows the wielder to fire a dart with a twist of the wrist. The launcher functions by means of a tightly compressed spring, and must be reloaded and re-cocked with a separate ramrod which takes an entire round. The device weighs one pound without ammunition and takes two rounds to first put on. It has an effective range of 20 feet. As the weapon easily hides up a loose sleeve, the wielder gains advantage on all checks made to conceal the weapon from sight. In order to properly use this uncommon weapon, the wielder must have practiced with it for at least one hour in the past week."
51,"A greataxe bearing a wrapped ebony haft with twin shining steel blades, which resemble the wings of a phoenix. A tiny talon grasps a ruby at the tip of the axe and its grip has been crafted to resemble a slumbering dragon with its teeth clamped down on a sapphire."
52,"A set of black, spiked gauntlets and greaves. The gauntlets resemble the spiky mane and claws of a wolf, while the greaves resemble clawed legs. White veins that glow pure white light cover the ridges of the armor."
53,"A pair of scimitars made of interlocking serrated plates, giving them a jagged edge. The pommels of each blade are sculpted into simple feline heads, the eyes glowing the blades respective color. One blade and pommel is a fiery orange, while the other glows a light windy blue."
54,A spiked shield made of strengthened rosewood and painted with the image of an overgrown rosebush. The painting is uniquely three dimensional as the plant's large thorns rise up and become the shield's spikes.
55,An exquisite bastard sword of an old fashioned design with a beautiful golden dragon head forming the hilt and powerful dwarven runes of friendship and peace down the entire length of the blade.
56,"A short sword with a blade that is five fingers wide at the base. Because of its width, the blade would be incredibly heavy without the fullers, or grooves, cut into the face. The handle and guard style sports a full bowl cross guard and the pommel has a foil twist."
57,"A broad longspear with two out-turned lugs at the base of the head, that forms a guard similar to that of a boar spear."
58,"A beautifully elegant rapier with a light-blue blade, thin fuller with the rest being onyx colored. The hilt is guarded by an elaborate silver basket guard, with the metal forming in a grapevine-like pattern. Engraved into the ricasso, in red dwarvish script, reads: “Ignus Vol”."
59,"A webbed rope belt that can be worn about the waist on a leather sash and buckle and hangs from a series of quick release loops. On one end of the weapon, three weighted leather balls hang on short strands of rope, forming a bola. While worn, these bola balls are tied to the large metal buckle and the bearer has advantage on any rolls made to disguise or or pass off the weapon as a simple belt. The bola can be tugged free with a simple snapping motion (Equivalent to drawing a weapon) and can be replaced in two rounds."
60,A fey-crafted pike made from still-living wood.
61,"An extravagantly carved, wooden war club with one end fashioned into the shape of a yellow serpent's wrinkly head. Violet, feathery plumes sprout from the top of the snake's head, and beneath its gaping jaw is a large, indigo ball painted with orange bands, one of which circles the ball while the other travelers in an undulating motion beneath it. The bands themselves consist of red squares separated at regular intervals by aquamarine columns."
62,"A longsword with a tear-drop shaped pommel set with a ruby the size of a small egg and a hilt wrapped in silver wire. The blade is blood red, while the sheath is the color of red wine and both are marked with a ancient symbol meaning “Misery” etched in black. A wielder can sense that the weapon has brought much pain and suffering but is also a thing of great beauty"
63,"A bastard sword with a curved crossguard and a slightly longer hilt than usual. An ancient glyph for “fire” is engraved on both the blade and the scabbard. The sword rests in a dark blue scabbard with a leaf-shaped steel cap on the end of the scabbard. The blade itself is a lighter iridescent blue and contains a cable-like patterns within it, as well as a flame-like pattern marked the transition between the soft spine of the blade and its hard edges. The black hardwood grip lies below the blued steel grip. The pommel is set with a large blue sapphire, held in place by four ribs (Which looked like claws) made from blued steel."
64,"A simple stonebow (Light crossbow statistics, deals bludgeoning damage) that's essentially a well engineered slingshot and fires rounded sling bullets. This weapon is favored as a hunting implement by peasants to kill small game such as rabbits and birds. These kills often use cheap and easy to make baked clay pellets, which can accurately hit small birds in flight without obliterating the corpse as a crossbow bolt or large arrow might. The weapon can be adjusted to launch nearly any type of small rounded object such as sling bullets, smooth stones or metal shot but cannot fire crossbow bolts."
65,"A scimitar with a stark white blade, hilt and crossguard that all ends in a pommel set with a gem as clear as a mountain spring. The entire weapon reminds an observer of sun-bleached bone, the color of death, not life and seems far more dangerous than any shade of black."
66,"A long, pale rapier with a wire-thin scratch winding down it. The blade is narrow enough to slip between an enemy's ribs without sacrificing any of its durability"
67,"A studded club that sports a small metal wedge at its tapered end and studs around the wide end. Bells, chimes, and whistles are fastened along the club, producing music and making a fearsome jangle in battle."
68,A light crossbow adorned with fine carvings and extravagant metalworkings.
69,"A curved shortsword with a dragon emblem etched into its hilt. There are five holes along the middle of the sharp blade, and five half-moon holes along the other side of the blade. The blade is split into two different colors, the sharp part is silver and the opposite is a dark mossy green. When the sword is used in combat, the wielder is flooded with wrathful energy and the blade turns completely red."
70,"A flail made of black steel engraved with depictions of human sacrifice. It has an abnormally long chain, and spikes are set into the pommel and handle as well as the striking head."
71,"A longsword with a blade made of an incandescent metal and stylized to appear like fire with a multi-colored disk set in the blade just above the crossguard. The grip is made of scaled silver, yet feels like smooth leather. The pommel resembles a dragon's claw grasping a small ruby. The crossguard is shaped like a dragon, its wings are pulled close to its back, it is stretched lengthwise perpendicular to the blade, with flecks of yellow diamonds for eyes."
72,A hideous composite bow of black-red iron and volcanic rock with a thorn covered string of demon sinew.
73,A morningstar with an ebony handle wreathed in silver accents that bears a cleanly cut jasper in the pommel.
74,A silvered war scythe with a dark blue handle and a pitch black blade with wisps of dark smoke coming off it.
75,"A mace made from black steel and covered in otherworldly chitin and bone. The white husk which encapsulates it leaves only a few spots of the mace's black metal visible, and at times the chiton seems to shift and move of its own accord."
76,"An ebony quarterstaff bound in gold, capped by an obsidian orb. The staff resonates with magical energy when held by an evil creature capable of casting magical spells."
77,"A pair of nunchaku (Club statistics) consisting of two wooden handles linked together by a length of twisted cord. Both handles are intricately carved into the shape of a serpent dragon-like creature, with scales engraved along their length and a head near the handle's base. As the weapon naturally folds in half, it is easier to hide up a loose sleeve or in a waistband and the wielder gains advantage on all checks made to conceal the weapon from sight. In order to properly use this uncommon weapon, the wielder must have practiced with it for at least two hours in the past week."
78,A pitch black halberd imbued with the captured terror of its victims. The chillingly cold blade releases a baleful aura when wielded that makes weaker foes tremble.
79,"A type of modified crossbow known as a flask launcher that fires vials, flasks, small bottles and potions. Objects launched in this fashion can typically travel much farther and more accurately than a wielder could throw them. The weapon (Light crossbow statistics) can be adjusted to launch nearly any type of small bottle type receptacle but cannot fire crossbow bolts. In order to properly use this uncommon weapon, the wielder must already be proficient with light crossbows and have practiced with it for at least one hour in the past week."
80,"A longspear made of a deep black wood that does not seem to have been stained black, its natural roughness seemingly unsanded. The spearhead is short and crescent shaped, curving back towards the shaft, leaving a convex blade on the end. The blade itself is made from a smooth, magically strengthened fire opal that glints with beautiful multi-colored lights."
81,"A yew shortbow that is more of a work of art than a weapon of war. Fine engravings dance over the polished wood, and the bowstring gleams of gold, almost singing when drawn."
82,"An exquisitely crafted glaive with a pure white shaft that cannot be dirtied, bearing an intricate pattern that glows like the morning sun decorating the entirety of the weapon. The blade itself has a menacing glow and is pitch black. The weapon always feels comforting and warm to the touch."

85,A curved sickle with purple lining on the edge of the blade and a grip wrapped in blue cloth.
86,A bony longbow with two skulls embedded in the thin limbs of the bow. A shortbow covered in small crystals that shimmer with an azure blue hue.
87,A black leather brace containing a half dozen throwing axes. Each one is fitted with a small aquamarine crystal set into the pommels and smaller slivers of the gem in the blades.
88,"A trident somehow formed from fresh seawater and ocean bedrock. The water flowing through the weapon is visible through the several cracks on the weapon and the wielder can always catch the scent of a fresh ocean breeze. A bronze longspear, ending in an iron two-bladed tip. The lower half of the bladed-tip is shaped like the sun and has a bronze cross as decoration, finishing off the sun-look."
89,A black leather brace containing a half dozen throwing hammers. Each one has a copper handle with gold engravings and a white marble head with more details in gold and the face of the God of Lighting carved at its the center.
90,"A composite bow with a grip wrapped in tight, black leather. At the cusp where nocked arrows rest against the handle, there is a golden metallic inlay. The rest of the bow is crafted from alchemically treated dragon bone that radiates heat. Arrows fired from the weapon fly at incredible speeds and the bow flexes forward with such intensity that it makes a roaring “Whoosh” sound followed by the crackling of flames."
91,"An enormous sword whose blade is a polished silver color with curling patterns and designs etched along the edge. The quillons of the fullblade have the designs of a sun and crescent moon pressed into them, and the pommel is in the shape of a silver rose."
92,A greatsword bearing the symbol of a chalice forged into the grip. The weapon's crossguard has been broken off and replaced with an Orcish hunting dagger that attaches onto the hilt and can be easily removed.
93,A wooden flatbow (Longbow statistics) with gold inlays at both ends and a red gem inlaid in another gold setting.
94,"A stylish, milk-white hornbow (Composite Bow statistics) that appears to be made primarily of ivory."
95,A quality steel rapier with the symbol of a shrike etched into the grip and a guard that resembles a spiny bramble of razor sharp thorns.
96,"A two foot square chunk of shaped hardened steel, this once simple hooked anchor can (In the right hands) be used as a destructive wave of force, crushing metal, bone and flesh before it. A bearer who is already proficient with mauls and has practiced with this object for at least one hour in the past week can wield it as a maul that deals bludgeoning or piercing damage (Wielder's choice). The weapon can be attached to a length of chain, allowing the bearer to wrap it around their hands and increase the reach or the weapon by five feet. In order to properly fight using the unwieldy chain and anchor fashion, the bearer must have practiced with it for at least six hours in the past week."
97,"A warhammer with the holy symbol of a God of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ etched into the grip. The weapon has the word “REPENT” in reversed raised type on its business end and powerful blows will leave large welts in the shape of the word."
98,"A greataxe formed of a handle of twisted roots, and a blade of roughly hewn stone. The roots grow around the blade where they meet and hold it firmly in place."
99,A scimitar with a jewel encrusted pommel and a silver blade with a diamond edge. The black adamantine hilt is masterfully sculpted into the likeness of the toothed maw of a hunting cat.
100,A rapier that shines like silver and remains perfectly reflective despite any use. The sword and its hilt (as well as the wielder's hand) are constantly bathed in harmless blue and silver flames. Visible at the the seat of the blade is an elven rune meaning “Weapon”.
