1,"A burlap bag containing a dozen assorted doorknobs."

21,"A battered stone shaped like a heart."
22,"A child's wooden doll that makes whoever looks at it uncomfortable."

27,"A small brass key."
28,"A hand mirror with a horn handle. Instead of actually functioning correctly, the mirror reflects all creature's image as a specific bald human of unknown origin."

30,"A spindly iron key."

67,"A stone statue of a goblin, paper-thin and hollow. If the statue is broken, goblin bones tumble out."

80,"A torn flag of an ancient city long since fallen into ruin."
81,"A dissected and flayed corpse of a tiny fey creature."
82,"A syringe with a squared-off crystal barrel. The plunger, flange, and needle hardware are nickel alloy ornately etched in twining, serpentine coils. Though it has no needle, and the plunger no longer seals, it is finely made, given its age."

87,"A length of heavy rusty chain, entangled in an impossible knot."
88,"A thick waxy candle the colour of sickly pallid skin. When burned, the smoky odor of roasting ghoulflesh fills the room, ideal for setting the mood for foul necromantic rituals, preparing volunteers for human sacrifice, and all manner of depraved acts involving corpses."

90,"A thick shirt of coarse brown horsehair."

99,"A copper coin with a small hole drilled at the top and attached to a long length of fishing line."
100,"A small, stained sack with a crudely painted figure of a halfling on the side. Opening the sack releases an odour that invokes tears and gagging to those nearby. The sack itself contains a number of crude items designed to disguise a goblin as a halfling. Laying the kit's inventory out on the ground, you assess its value as a tool for subterfuge and determine a figure of zero. The wig leaves an odor of wet dog on your hands. The goblin disguise kit contains the following items: a chopped and damp wig made from worg fur, flesh-toned paste that burns when applied, a set of incomprehensibly disgusting false teeth, a canvas tunic with a poorly painted “shirt front,” and a pair of greasy gloves."
