1,"A casket of oak covered with ivory and ebony marquetry in the shape of a curled up and sleeping cat."
2,"A long, crystal bottle with a narrow neck. The sealed vessel contains distilled cordial of halo-flower harvested from the dreamworld of Aenir."

4,"A hand sized piece of ^Humanoid^ leather with a slave merchant's brand on it."
5,"A shattered mask, once belonging to an ordained Sester. Though broken this mask still retains a trace of its original religious purpose. It hums with faint whispers when worn. They demand an offering."
6,"A jeweler's ticket that says the bearer can present this receipt and retrieve their ring after it has been professionally cleaned in a nearby city. The writing states the work has not been paid for and the bearer will have to pay Roll 5d4 silver upon pickup which should take no more than two days. For proper claiming purposes, the ticket has the first sentence of the following description written on it: ^AllRings^"
7,"A headband made from gilt bronze."
8,"A burnt and tattered scrap of fabric, once part of a regimental standard. Whenever it's grasped, a few words flow into the bearer's mind as if long forgotten but suddenly remembered; “We didn't let them capture the flag, captain. You would have been proud of us.”"
9,"A large crude drum with the word “War” scrawled in Giant."
10,"A muck-covered glass jar filled with small, white, writhing worms that possess haggard human faces. If the jar is opened, thrown at something or otherwise destroyed, the worms rapidly cannibalize one another until only one remains. The last remaining worm will become large and bloated upon feasting on its brethren. It will attempt, in a shrill voice, to convince someone nearby to eat it."
11,"A mind flayer doll which has a tiny astral cord attached."
12,"A soft leather riding saddle over a light frame, designed for comfort. Every good saddle eventually conforms to horse and rider, like a favorite shoe or an old hat. The narrow skirt below the seat is stamped and scrolled. On the wood under the pommel, a name is branded. The stirrup irons show the wear of a thousand rides, and the blanket below is undoubtedly soft on the horse, colored and patterned for beauty as well as utility."
13,"A multihued shard of unidentifiable crystal that seems to reflect a verdant forest rather than the expected surroundings, no matter its physical location."
14,"A heavy fang the size of a man's hand that could only have belonged to a ferocious predatory beast. You feel at ease knowing there's one less of those monsters in the world."

16,"A leather bracelet adorned with shed claws and teeth."
17,"A multi-colored glass globe approximately three inches in diameter. Further examination will reveal that the interior of the globe is filled with crisscrossing strands of glass. The object is very fragile, and must be either hung up or else carefully carried to avoid breakage."
18,"A mage's staff capped with a diamond-shaped formation of metal on each end. The shaft is made of a light, flexible wood."
19,"An amateur taxidermy python, posed in a knotted-up position with a forced, unnatural smile on its face. Its wooden stand resembles a bumpy chunk of rock, with a branch for the snake to rest on and a handful of dusty, fake leaves glued on. The snake's beady, fake eyes are unusually bright and reflective, even in near complete darkness."
20,"An arcane rod made of obsidian with a red dragon etched in relief spiraling the length of the rod. The dragon appears to glow as if a fire burns within the rod, which is warm to the touch."
21,"A set of 3d4 lovely silver dining forks wrapped carefully in a torn strip of dyed linen."
22,"A fist sized stone that has naturally developed a perfect likeness of the divine symbol of the ^Humanoid^ God of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ within its striations. While it can't be used as a holy symbol without being blessed and anointed, it might be worth something to a priest or devotee of the God."
23,"A simple silver bell adorned with depictions of angels and birds."
24,"A tangled ball of silver wire."
25,"A tall, conical hat embroidered with silver and golden swirling threads."
26,"A wide brimmed hat that always shadows the eyes, even when the bearer looks directly into light."

28,"An ancient, carven figurine, plucked from the secret halls of the city beneath. It has a strangely familiar aspect."

30,"A crystal sphere, half encased in volcanic rock."
31,"A hound-master's whistle made from a piece of a deer antler, with a silver mouthpiece. Its single mid-range tone is strong and audible at a long distance."
32,"A pocketwatch broken beyond repair. Somehow, the gears are so bungled that merely winding the watch emits a screeching, grinding drone."
33,"A lute, sized for a child. Goat-gut strings, and made of waxed kauri wood."
34,"A crocheted handbag, painstakingly woven with over a dozen images of lizards."
35,"A tiny, gilded metal box, the size of a closed fist, locked tight. All efforts to open it have so far proven ineffectual. When shaken, it makes soft clinking sounds, as if tiny glass objects are bouncing off one another inside."
36,"A big floppy hat made of silk with dozens of tiny semiprecious stones sewn around the brim."
37,"A single iron nail taken from the gallows where the most infamous killer who ever lived was hanged."
38,"A finger-sized barb from the stinger of a giant bee."
39,"A smooth, rounded river rock with a rose scraped into its face."
40,"A glass bottle containing a thick clear liquid with flakes of bright silver suspended in it. Pale wax coats and seals the flask's cork. A sacred symbol has been embossed in this wax, and the same symbol has been painted on the glass. Knowledgeable PC's are able to identify the contents as holy water, which burns fiends and undead like acid but never harms the innocent."
41,"A heavy sheepskin hat suitable for wear in stormy climes."
42,"A land grant, bearing the seal of a dead official, declaring Lord Farhad and his daughter Ara to be the rightful owners of Seven Lake Country. As far as you know, Farhad and Ara have been dead for years, and Seven Lake Country is way, way out into the wilderness; but still, if you can pass yourself off as a descendant, maybe you can find more profit than they did out on the frontier…"
43,"A gilt cage, sized for a songbird, with ornamented base depicting wild animals."
44,"An amethyst brooch of complex interwoven silver and gold wire."
45,"A sequined squid skin belt pouch."
46,"A spool of fine wire copper wire that could be useful for setting trip-wires, rigging up pulleys, or conducting electricity."
47,"A wooden spool wound with four yards of red satin ribbon."
48,"A leather wallet stamped with the emblem of a prestigious library of the nearest metropolis. It contains a large stack of officially signed and stamped certificates of academic qualifications such as baccalaureates, diplomas and degrees, all filled out with the same almost-illegible name. These would be extremely useful in the hands of people who want to pretend that they have knowledge or status they don't really possess such as spies, charlatans, or college drop-outs."
49,"A strange death whistle made of obsidian and inlaid with bronze, iron, copper, and silver. When played, it makes a loud screaming sound that drives fear and pain into the minds of those who hear it."

51,"A padded combat training dummy that mends any damage done to it at dusk each day."
52,"A small, paper-wrapped package containing a dozen decorative wooden hair sticks."
53,"A marble sized bead that is black, almost obsidian in its shine. Perfectly spherical, perfectly smooth. As you pick it up, you feel the immense weight of it (Much heavier than you expected) though you know it can't actually weigh as much as that. It must be some sort of trick."
54,"A metal and enamel mask in the shape of a raven's face."
55,"A large magnolia blossom made from fine bone china."
56,"A well-made, silver chain bracelet with small silver heart charms hanging off each link. A single one of these charms is carved from a rose zircon, which gives off a small amount of heat."

58,"A map displaying various constellations with “The stars are right!” Scrawled under them in red."

61,"A floral veil used in Vampire rituals. Its once vibrant redness has been sucked empty, leaving nothing only a pale white color to the blossoms."

67,"A dreamcatcher made of a twig, sinew, and hemp string."
68,"A tea kettle that heats itself when filled with clean water."
69,"A small, unassuming tack hammer, with a delicate bronze head and a smooth wooden handle. It exudes a faint magical aura of an evil nature, but no amount of divining or scrying will reveal its precise magical powers."
70,"A fireproof, ogre sized blanked of braided hide strips and silver hair."

73,"A carved wooden likeness of a beloved pet."
