4,"Still Life: A detailed 4 foot by 3 foot watercolor painting depicts a poker game, held in a musty, low-ceilinged attic. The scene is lit by two lanterns, one in the center of the table and the other hanging from the wall behind one of the players and the light of dusk from the single window through which a cutter can be seen on the distant ocean. The four players (A tabaxi, half-orc, elf and gnome, all dressed in tatty seafaring gear) are sitting on barrels and crates and several dozen gold and silver pieces are in the center of the table as they play. The scene in the painting moves with incredible slowness (Slow enough that the casual watcher may not notice until a few minutes have passed) and actually depicts the progress of an hour of this poker game, played out over the course of 120 hours in real time. During this, it is clear that the tabaxi is cheating and the gnome violently calls them out, throwing a tankard at them. A fight erupts between all four, resulting in the lanterns being knocked to the ground. As they impact, flames explode slowly, filling the painting over the course of ten minutes with red, then white, then it fades back to the beginning of the scene."
