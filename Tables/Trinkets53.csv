When the drinker swallows the sour watery cider, they cannot help but smile. One hour after a drink, various changes are made to the drinker's anatomy. The first glass causes the skin to darken to red. The second drink causes a pair of small horns to sprout above the eyes on the forehead. The third mouthful causes a wispy long tail to sprout from the drinker's back side. A fourth drink causes nails to elongate and harden.

There is a list of instructions in the bottom corner of the map: Find the hangman's scaffold, then go south-east for 3-4 miles until you find the road marker pointing west. From there, go east for 2-3 miles, until you find the minaret, then go east for 1-2 miles and you'll find broken remains of a watchtower. The holy altar inside is guarded by spirits. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end.
