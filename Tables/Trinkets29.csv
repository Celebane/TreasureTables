Known for being a smokey, aromatic wine, its taste is almost unbearably sweet, flowing down one's throat like liquid smoke.

6,A box containing a small pair of gold hoop earrings. A paper inside says “Lidia's first”.
7,"A jade mirror that exaggerates the features of those who looked into it in order to reveal their true nature through a sort of magical caricature. An honorable and virtuous person would appear stronger, taller, and more fair in visage. A selfish, greedy individual would appear smaller, with cruel, conniving features. Those with an injury or disability that they had allowed to cripple their spirit would appear withered and weak, while those who had overcome their disability would appear in perfect health."
8,A musical rattle made from a cloven hoof that smells faintly of brimstone.
9,"A wicker basket containing several loafs of weighty bread wrapped in a thin blanket. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize it as Stonebread, a type of baked good made by dwarves. Usually made into round loaves, this foodstuff is so foul-tasting that only dwarfs can eat it. In fact, it is rumored that it is made using rock dust rather than flour. However, to the dwarfs, it is hearty fare that is very fortifying. In addition, it keeps extremely well."

18,"A sinister looking lute whose head ends in a wicked spike. The cords are thicker than average and made from thin, woven steel wires. The neck is much longer than normal, and mimics the appearance of a spine. The base is unlike the normal rounded body of a lute, and is pointed and made of a mildly glowing purple rock. The top half of the body is much larger and than bottom, and ends much more jaggedly. The instrument seems to hum with electric power when wielded and any songs played on this lute sound distorted and powerful."
19,"A massive scarlet lobster claw, the length of a grown man's arm."

73,"An attractive statuette depicting an androgynous figure standing with one arm covering the chest and the other covering the groin.

The outside is rimmed with salt crystals which regenerate when brushed away, but these don't seem to affect the chalice itself.
