1,"An umbilical cord in a neat wooden box, lined with velvet. The cord itself has small, glassy eyes over its surface."
2,"A disc of black iron four inches across and almost an inch thick, set with raised sigils around the edge, one side having a leather cover held in place by a strap. If the cover is removed a spiraling set of sigils is revealed, each like a twisted spider and there is something deeply unwholesome in the way they hold the eye and seemed to writhe. Touching the sigils underneath the cover creates feeling of extreme pain as if the disc was white hot iron. The feelings dissipate the second the disc isn't making direct contact with skin."
3,"An iron bracelet shaped like a coiled serpent with rhodochrosite eyes."
4,"A simple looking box made of plain, unstained and untreated pine boards. The box is two feet high, three feet wide and one foot deep, and has horrific pictures of undead silhouettes burned on the outside of it. The lid is attached by a simple brass hinge and bears foul necromantic symbols. Inside, the box holds ashes that look suspiciously like cremation remains."
5,"A roll of old bandages that has been inked with strange pictograms."
6,"An unusual standing lamp made of brass sporting a vented wheel over top of its wick and a number of crystal chimes along its outer edges. When lit, the rising hot air from the flame slowly turns the wheel which has a number of outward reaching pins which strike the chimes creating soothing tinkling noises, while the light refracting from the crystals creates a rosy glow. While much more suited for an upscale pleasure den, the lamp is sturdy enough for travel if carefully wrapped in fabric beforehand. The lamp will burn for six hours on a flask (One pint) of oil."
7,"A pewter goblet with dark and rancid blood lurking within. The lip is black and caked where it appears others have tasted from it. Scratched deep into the pewter are the words “Taste My Fear.”"
8,"A vest fashioned from the hide of a large darkhaired ape."
9,"A gallon jug of thick smoky glass wrapped in braided twine. The container is filled with a potent liquor strong enough to strip paint from wood. Only the eldest brigands of the wildlands know the secret to distilling a libation so pure. The devout have no need of drink, but vagabonds always thirst for more. One who consumes this superior moonshine feels they can take on the world and is filled with resolve."
10,"A demonic gnoll totem of gold and silver coins hammered and nailed into a chunk of wood topped with a sheep skull."
11,"A shard of a mirror that shows strange shadows in its reflections."
12,"A bizarre, metallic lump of iridescent crystals of concentric geometric shapes expanding outward in rough steps. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as bismuth."
13,"A small silver dish inscribed with a smiling moon that will fill with fresh milk or food when placed in front of kittens, orphans, and kindly old half-blind men."
14,"A black glass orb eight inches in diameter, that appears to have octopus tentacles that reach to grasp the inside of the sphere. Often, they separate, revealing one large cephalopod eye."
15,"A steel mirror set in a fanged maw of iron."
16,"A mask made from white ceramic in the round shape of a cherubic human child's face. The lips are painted bright red and the hair deep black. The eyes are blank and empty."
17,"A one gallon cask of Well Wishes Whisky that has a smooth finish and a warm, golden scent. This whisky is distilled from an ancient wishing well and rumor has it that the liquor grants people luck when drunk. Knowledgeable PC's have heard that it is especially popular among students at the Wizard Academy during exam time."
18,"A mage's rod made of the smoothest black wood. It stands about three feet in height and had a base of five inches or so. At the top held by four intertwining pieces of silver ivy is held a crystal orb."
19,"A set of pewter tankards, five in all, which have various pictures of historic castles and their coats of arms. On the back of each tankard is a verse which, if deciphered, will reveal a ribald and amusing fact about the holders of the coats of arms."
20,"A small leather pouch, about the size of a book. Unfastened, it reveals inside several sheets of fine writing paper, a wooden stylus, a wax tablet, two quills and a pen-knife plus a small bottle of ink. A careful examination of one of the sheets of paper will reveal that it bears the impression of what was written on the sheet above it (now long gone). This will be the first half of a letter that gives some tantalizing hints regarding a mystery of the DM's choosing."
21,"A tall, black hat of a witchfinder, inside the hat is sewn the name Erasmus Pottingley."
22,"A roughly circular slab of obsidian an inch thick, or thereabouts, and just the right size to be cradled comfortably in one's palms. Roughly shaped around its circumference, though one broad side is simply stone-pecked to a slightly convex, pitted surface the other has been polished to such a high degree that the surface is unblemished as still water. Perfectly smooth, the polished side can act as a fine (If dark) mirror. Those who peer into the silky smooth reflective face of slab long enough, however, see floating within the midnight depths a rendition of the starry skies in smoky points of light. Focused on the zodiacal constellations, these tiny dark “stars” change with the day and the seasons in perfect step with those in the sky above."
23,"A small idol made of bone and crimson gems of unknown nature. It represents the blackened skull of a horned ox with six red eyes that seem to gleam slightly in the dark."
24,"A burlap sack in which is stored a 2d4+1 days' worth of trail rations. The foodstuffs take the semi-appetizing form of sparrow jerky which has been pressed into small cakes of many thin sheets. Each cake is wrapped its own linen cloth for travel."
25,"A cherry-wood box carved with arcane symbols of conjuration and binding. The interior is covered with scratches made by small claws. Knowledge PC's can deduce from the nature of the magical runes that the box is meant to trap and contain an imp so that it can be become a mage's familiar."
26,"A fine pine box bound with a leather strap. Inside are five hand rolled cigars. They smell of spice, toasted almonds, and honey. They look quite expensive."
27,"A small ivory box, carefully engraved at all sides. It depicts scenes of a nobility: feasts, dances, a marriage, and peasants tending fields. On the inside, it is divided into small square compartments. They were probably meant to store makeup or perfumes, yet none remain. It might have been part of noble bride's dowry."
28,"An old but seemingly undamaged piece of abstract art containing a pattern designed to befuddle the viewer's brain."
29,"A floor tile with a footprint on it that reads: “Step here to summon Balog.” The tile is slightly charred."
30,"A cheap wax seal stamp, depicting a generic shield shape."
31,"A light woman's coat with the emblem of a gryphon embroidered to the back of it."

33,"A pewter brooch with a galloping horse embossed on it."
34,"A silver turtle shaped locket with a black opal shell. Inside the locket is a picture of somebody's loved one."
35,"A scabbard of black ash and bronze decorated with a sneering bearded face with tourmaline eyes. It is suitable for longsword or similar straight blade."
36,"A large tapestry depicting an ancient battle with tentacled monsters."
37,"A missing poster with the image of a well dressed Minotaur and his children. It reads, “Hyam Hyrule. A loving, kind and down to earth family man. 200 gold reward to whoever can find him alive.”"
38,"A candle made from the grisly, severed hand of a hanged criminal, if lit it is believed to help people remain undetected as they enter an abode."
39,"A soft cloth handkerchief on which is a limerick, written in blood: There once was a man with one sandal. His appetites most couldn't handle. He stalks the streets hunting souls. Cooks their feets over coals. And writes limericks about being a cannibal. A soft cloth handkerchief splattered with blood."
40,"A scrap of parchment that reads; “It is done. Meet me in the graveyard at dawn, near the crypt.”"
41,"A fine doublet of incredible intricacy and beauty, with a pattern of nymphs playing in a garden along the back."
42,"A beautiful painting of a late autumn lake in the forest. The longer you look at it, the more mesmerizing it becomes. As you stare, the leaves on the trees seems to jostle in the wind, the lake seems to breathe as water, and the clouds seem to drift ever so slightly into the sunset, like a portal into a perfect glimmer of peace. The only curiosity is a sad old man with a gnarled crown sitting upon a small bench, not quite in the foreground though impossible to ignore. He seems to loom over the lake, and is vaguely familiar… He seems to weep, giving the painting a sense of loss and sadness, as if this world so perfect was dying with him."
43,"A boldly colored quartz the size of a pigeon's egg, etched and painted in such a way that when it is placed to one's eye in the light, they see a clever but naughty image of a beautiful person in the nude."
44,"A baby's blanket made of the finest cloth. It was kept in a mothballed container for years. It smells faintly of mint, as if someone meant to store it for a very long time."
45,"A durable, clear glass bottle filled with ashes and a note. The says “These are my wife's ashes. She always wanted to see the world but spent her life looking after me and our children. Please take her with you on your travels, we'd both appreciate it”."
46,"A spiked red leather dog collar with a steel dog tag on it that  reads “Murderface”."
47,"A sadistic violin that no matter how much it's tuned, will always play terribly. The instrument seems to want to annoy and bring misery to as many people as it can. If anyone ever starts to actually enjoy the out of tune music, the violin will change to a different worse sound, ensuring no listener ever brought joy by its sounds."
48,"A fist-sized glass bauble with beautiful coruscating colored lights inside."
49,"An iron gorget with a large peridot in the center of it."
50,"An ancient cup, now cracked and chipped, that was carefully carved out of a single large block of translucent red amber."
51,"A simple framed painting of a figure leaning back in a chair, it's face shrouded in shadow."
52,"A small, black, triangular stone, about the size of a human's fist. Engraved in the center is a spiraling mark."
53,"A perverse and gaudy replica of a cleric's mask. When this facial covering is worn, the spirit feels nebulous, boundless even. The vast distances between each being dissolves, revealing a vision of the world beheld by a thousandfold eyes."
54,"A censer filled with perfumed incense that can be held or hung from chains. The sweet smell wafting from this censer hides a poisonous reaction within. Knowledgeable PC's will know by the style of the stylized inscriptions that cultists used these burnt offerings to confuse and confound their senses. In a state of rapturous delirium, they behold obscene truths and righteous falsehoods."
55,"A crudely made jack in the box child's toy constructed from unfinished unpainted pine carelessly hammered together with varying sized of nails. The crank is a rough twist of metal bound with a length of burlap over the handle. On the front of the box, burned into the wood are the words “Turn the crank, close your eyes, and pray to the gods for a pleasant surprise.”"
56,"A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it that seem to be arranged in some sort of pattern."

59,"A wooden peg-leg in the shape of a dragon's leg complete with splayed-toed clawed foot tipped with hooked claws of iron."
60,"A shipwreck in a water-filled glass globe. At the bottom is a massive kraken with tentacles up through the water. The ship is in big pieces that float with different levels of buoyancy. There are tiny sailors that float and sink to the bottom."
61,"An incredibly life-like sandstone statue of a cockatiel."
62,"A chipped and cracked porcelain tea cup with a rose and leaf motif marked with a stamp on its bottom in an unknown language."
63,"An agate scarab the size of a human palm with writing in Mulhorandi that reads “Even in death, I serve”."
64,"A brass and crystal hourglass that when turned over plays softly tinkling chimes as the sand passes through it for the unit of time known as a “song”, lasting a minute or two."
65,"A seemingly normal conch shell. When pressed to the ear, faint sounds of surf and wind, rustling palms and crying gulls can be heard. The area around the listener's ear is specked with sand afterwards."
66,"A pair of carefully wrapped baby shoes, never worn."
67,"A silver holy symbol sculpted to resemble a shining sun. Such an image is sometimes used by clerics and paladins not associated with any particular deity. The amulet is small enough to be gripped in one hand and a religious bearer can feel that it contains the divine spark of a truly holy object."
68,"A gilded acorn containing a feather, a tuft of fur and a fish tail."
69,"A one gallon cask of The Nine Hells, an alcoholic beverage that's traditionally served in tiny flasks. The drink is a very potent brew of vodka, extra-strength peppermint, pure capsaicin extract and garnished with a single drop of wolf's blood in each serving."

72,"A copper chalice engraved with a geometric pattern."
73,"A wooden jeweler box with copper detailing."
74,"A simple chunk of flint broken off of a larger rock eons ago by natural forces. A closer inspection, however, reveals one edge of the rock has been carefully napped down to a razor edge, while the opposite side has been shaped into a crude handgrip. Small, primitive figures of deer, wolves, and bears are etched into the stone. The carvings sometimes appear to have changed places of their own accord, though they never move while being observed."

76,"A copper candle holder shaped like a galloping horse."
77,"An embroidered silk tablecloth edged with lace."

94,"A small, framed painting of a castle, the details of which (The number of towers and parapets, the banners flown, siege weaponry on the battlements, and similar features) change subtly when no one is looking."
