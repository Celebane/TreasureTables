1,"A recalled golden coin with an unflattering accurate depiction of the king on one side and a crude limerick about his mother on the obverse."
2,"A foul corset crafted from the flesh of elves and the bones of dwarves. The woven hair of halfling children forms the garment's ties. The image of a small woman standing inside a thick circle is sewn into the inside pocket of the left breast. Knowledgeable PC's have heard a folk legend about a woman wearing a corset of this description who was rumored to have walked into a sleepy hamlet on the border of a swamp and blinded every man, woman, child and farm animal."
3,"A rich brown stone that appears opaque, fading to translucent at the edges. A sliver of yellow emerges in the center no matter which way it is turned to catch the light. Knowledgeable PC's can identify it as a tiger's eye gem."
4,"A rod made from a thick and twisted ironwood branch that comes to three points almost like a wooden talon. Red crackling energy arcs from the center of the talon-like tip. It can be used as a spellcasting focus for arcane magic."
5,"A bright pink vest the color of fresh internal tissue, covered in tentacle designs."
6,"A heavy key made of antique brass, its surface covered with innumerable scratches. At one end, a large oval ringlet that can be used to hang the key from a ring or hook. At the other, nothing. Where one would expect to find teeth, the shaft of the key is smooth, bearing no indication that it had ever had teeth. Curiously, several small notches can found near the ringlet, their number ever changing."
7,"A small collapsible grappling hook that has flat, retractable tines that fold out. Because it can be collapsed to a small size when not in use, it is much harder to find it when it is folded and hidden among a person's garments."
8,"A black granite statuette of a snarling, rampant tiger, with eyes and stripes picked out with silver leaf."
9,"A six-foot tall, one-foot wide candle that stands upright on any flat surface. It clearly illuminates a 25-foot radius and burns for ten hours. The surface of this standing candle is inscribed with arcane runes, esoteric symbols and other occult markings that make it appear significant and magical, though it is entirely mundane."
10,"A blue and white porcelain plate depicting willow trees, cranes and a temple."
11,"A black velvet eye patch studded with many small diamonds."
12,"A glowing blue shard of a broken sword blade that hums with mystical power. If a person holds the piece for long enough they will start hearing voices that urge them to kill and claim souls for it."
13,"A bronze statuette depicting a female ^Humanoid^. A butterfly is perched on her extended hand."
14,"A bullseye lantern composed of thin sheets of hardened fish leather darkened to opaqueness, with a bone framework. The lantern has only a single shutter; its other sides are coated with a special wax to reflect the light in a single direction. It illuminates a cone 60 feet long and 20 feet wide at the end and it burns for four hours on a single flask of oil."
15,"A burlap bag containing a shaman's outfit that includes moccasins, trousers, a simple shirt and an elaborate (If rather frightening) mask. Braided into the clothing are a number of beads and feathers, with painted sigils and swirls denoting the spirits the shaman is beholden to."
16,"A burlap pouch filled with 4d4 small, hexagonal, rusted iron coins that feel surprisingly heavy given their size."
17,"A cameo brooch depicting the profile of a serenely smiling medusa."
18,"A carved moonstone hairpin, crowned by a large bloodshot eyeball. Flicking the shaft causes the pupil to flash brilliantly."
19,"A coin sized piece of adamantine that has naturally eroded into a disc."
20,"A collection of perfectly preserved, brightly colored flower heads that have been lovingly arranged and encased in a clear glass hemisphere."
21,"A copper armband cast in the shape of a snake eating its tail. A tiny chip of green jade forms each eye."
22,"A crude map of the local area inscribed on a tattered canvas scroll, that bears an “X” marking an area near where the map was found. There is a list of instructions in the bottom corner of the map: Find the exact center of the lake, then go south-west for 3-4 miles until you find the toppled statue of a deity. From there, go east for 2-3 miles, until you find the old granite quarry, then go south-east for 1-2 miles and you'll find the safe house guarded by assassins. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end. The map could easily be a prank, trap, confidence scheme, ambush or the area could already have been stripped of any value by other adventurers."
23,"A crystal orb filled with water and has no visible opening but is covered in arcane script."
24,"A darkwood box lined with red velvet that holds eight slightly tarnished bronze hairpins each adorned with a small animal carving. Indentations in the velvet indicate four pins are missing."
25,"A deerskin quiver painted with a band of wood elf hunters chasing after a great boar."
26,"A dire tigerskin rug with a stuffed head and a gaping maw full of yellowing teeth."
27,"A dusty bottle of vintage white wine called “Golden Nectar.”"
28,"A figurine of a praying mantis carved from transparent green and colorless, mottled jade."
29,"A fine brown woolen shawl, embroidered with a light green vine pattern."
30,"A fine oak case containing a series of paints, each with a little heart carved into the top of each paint pot."
31,"A fist sized orb made of a spongy mass of swirling vibrant colors enclosed within a coil of rusted iron."
32,"A fist sized sphere of fine crystal, perfectly smooth and lustrous. A close examination of the orb shows faint lines of writing etched into the surface. The language is ancient, no longer known by any speaker alive."
33,"A two-foot-long mahogany rod, banded in segments like a scorpion's tail."
34,"A two-foot-long brass rod, with the end sculpted to resemble a pointing finger."
35,"A forest green felt drawstring pouch that contains four cut stones, in varying shades of translucent yellow and grey. Knowledgeable PC's can identify them as zircons."
36,"A four-inch pyramid of polished obsidian."
37,"A frilly white silk shirt, suitable for dueling and dancing."
38,"A gold earrings with three small rubies and a gold-dipped arrowhawk feather."
39,"A gold-plated cylindrical pen with a fanciful dragon head at one end. Its nib is a bit of dragon's claw."
40,"A greyish withered hand that smells of charcoal and lavender. A metal cuff and mechanical structure covers the palm, back, and fingers. All the metal components are carved with dwarven runes and human lettering."
41,"A large heavy coin cast of pure gold that has seen far better days. The filthy lucre originates from an ancient city hidden in the ocean depths."
42,"A large polished wooden globe on a stand, depicting the Known World and many unknown lands."
43,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of a bountiful orchard whose trees are overflowing with fruit, the ripest of which has fallen and filled a cornucopia. The container is brimming with dozens of well-preserved dried strawberries."
44,"A large transparent purple amethyst crystal embedded in a grey granite hemisphere."
45,"A leather footstool made from a stuffed bulette's leg."
46,"A leather wallet stamped with the image of an intricate crystal goblet. It contains a full set of certified identification papers denoting that the bearer is a member of the glassblowers and glaziers guild. The section containing the member's physical description (Height, weight, se,X race, eye, skin and hair color) is completely blank and could be filled in by anyone with half decent handwriting."
47,"A leatherworker's toolkit that includes all the equipment necessary for a person to soak, tan, boil, wax and sew leather armor (Or other leather goods), which is essential to both construct and repair such armor."
48,"A light linen traveling smock tailored for a long, slender frame and embroidered sweetly with a pattern of chained wildflowers along the hem."
49,"A vicious-looking armlet that takes the form of a four-taloned claw of emaciated black flesh which grips the wrist. Between the knuckles a blue-and-black eyeball gazes and two vibrating grey gems are set on either side. It is quite painful to don as the talons sink into the flesh but causes the bearer to feel exceptionally powerful."
50,"A lightly colored linen, hooded robe that helps to reflect the harsh heat of the sun. It is large, loose and breathable, allowing it to be worn over other clothing or armor."
51,"A locket of rose quartz, oval and hinged with cunningly-hidden pins. It sports a carved suspension-loop but no chain."
52,"A long, preserved left index finger from a medium-sized humanoid of indeterminate gender or race. The finger is emaciated, skin clinging to bone and it has the waxen pallor of the undead. It twitches spasmodically every so often and occasionally a dozen or so tiny white undulating tendrils protrude from the base of the finger before quickly retreating."
53,"A mahogany pipe whose bulb is carved to resemble the head of a bearded wizard."
54,"A marble charm carved in the shape of a human skull. Its eye sockets are set with two spectral flames that glow faintly."
55,"A white marble bo,X small enough to conceal between cupped hands, with a tiny purple door set in to one side. Knocking on the little door with the tip of a finger causes it to open silently inward, revealing the dark interior of the bo,X from which a pair of implacable blue eyes stare out, unblinking. A barely perceptible breeze is constantly drawn into the door, which will close after a single word has been whispered into it."
56,"A military banner emblazoned with the image of a paladin clad in fine plate armor, her sword raised to the heavens, and the sun shining above him. The banner seems to always flutter as if in a constant breeze."
57,"A one gallon cask of Black Midnight, a drink created by necromancers to honor fallen necromancers. Bitter with a touch of rum, those who drink it have nightmares of dying and spending an eternity rotting away inside a coffin. This helps enforce the dark wizards to contemplate their own moralities."
58,"A pair of organic leggings made from stitched together leaves. They are extremely scratchy and uncomfortable to wear."
59,"A pair of bifocal spectacles made of a fine but durable crystal. The arms are inscribed with precise lettering detailing the maker's name and the location of her business."
60,"A pair of tailor's shears that can easily cut through any kind of leather."
61,"A parchment map of the Lonely Coast showing the hidden cave in the cliffs where the lost treasure of Peder Uren lies."
62,"A perfectly-preserved body of a large and beautiful Emperor Dragonfly, seven inches from end to end, its body a shining black-on-sky-blue with green highlights, its wings a translucent purple and its tail a vibrant, almost golden yellow."
63,"A porcelain goblet shaped like a large egg, cut open."
64,"A portable stove that when closed and packed up for transport in the included leather harness, is little more than a clay sphere a foot wide. The portable stove contains all of the utensils and equipment needed to cook a wide range of meals, including a heating surface for the included pot, a grilling rack and a small griddle. Using the stove involves opening it and attaching the halves together in an hourglass shape. The upper bowl holds coals that can be ignited with a flint and steel striker, while the lower bowl has small venting holes that help circulate air around the stove and keep it from shattering from the heat. A portable stove holds enough materials for one week's worth of repeated cooking; its supplies can be cheaply and easily replenished easily in any normal town."
65,"A pouch crafted of tanned human flesh holding 12 figurines, carved from darkwood and brightly painted. Each represents a different denizen of the jungle, though all of them have exaggerated fangs and claws."
66,"A protective leather tube containing an elaborately woven tapestry depicting nearly a dozen dragons in combat with each other over a burning city."
67,"A sack of finely ground pure white salt. Nearly worthless in a coastal town, salt is worth its weight in gold far inland for preserving meats and flavoring food."
68,"A scepter of black iron polished brightly, tipped at the base with an undulating blade of steel and at the head with an egg of smoky quartz."
69,"A sealed waterproof pouch containing 1d4+2 pounds of an amalgam of crushed stones, sand and alchemical ingredients known as Quickrock. This substance can be mixed with water and formed into rock-hard shapes before it dries. Working with quickrock requires a Craft (Pottery) or Craft (Sculpture) check or other related proficiency or skill. One pound of quickrock creates a cubic foot of stone as hard as granite and dries within one hour of being mixed and left to set."
70,"A set of clerical robes crafted from durable wool and blessed with holy water by temple priests for a fortnight."
71,"A set of grotesque animal barding crafted with horns, scales and other body parts from devils and demons. Sized for a horse, the barding is horrible to behold."
72,"A set of pipes made from a series of skeletal femurs fastened together with leather. Each of the bones have small holes similar to a flute or recorder. The pipes produce an eerie, uncomfortable sound, similar to a lover's lament."
73,"A set of six marble canopic jars topped with lids depicting animal-headed deities of Khemet."
74,"A short, broad-mouthed beaker of ony,X used to collect blood from sacrifices. Its lip are carved to appear clutched by grasping claws."

76,"A silver cuff that fits snugly around the wrist. A silver flange protrudes from the cuff to the center of the bearer's palm, where it attaches to a round crystal disk. The clear crystal emits waves of rainbow colors in bright light."
77,"A simple distillation kit that uses the sun and the ambient heat to evaporate pure water from body or cooking waste, salt lakes, poisonous plant saps, and so on. This “solar still” consists of a sheet of glass fastened at an angle into a frame, with a lip and a small spout (The components are packed separately and assembled when needed). The bottom and sides of the frame are covered with black oilcloth, the edges sealed with grease or tar to make it watertight. To use the still, pour the dirty water into the bottom of the container, then place the glass lid on top. The water evaporates and condenses on the underside of the glass surface, where it runs down and collects in the lip, dripping through the spout and producing about one gallon of water on a sunny day (If the container is filled to capacity)."
78,"A simple wooden box containing a number of glass bottles filled with quality seasonings, exotic spices and fine powders, ground to varying degrees of fineness."
79,"A small ivory scroll case."
80,"A small piece of heavily folded parchment, on which is written an IOU for “One Large Favor”. The paper is marked with the badge of a mercenary band known as The Howling Worgs."
81,"A small statuette carved from jade, depicting a man in regal robes with the head of a raven."
82,"A small stone cube (Six inches on a side) which contains an unappetizing mulch of various types of mushroom and other organic bits, covered with a wool screen. Knowledgeable PC's recognize this as a box of Dwarven fungal rations, used to feed miners and explorers for weeks at a time. On top of the screen, a dozen or more edible mushrooms grow, feeding on the material below the screen. The dwarven reared, densely nutritious mushrooms will continue to grow at a regular rate, providing enough food for a single human sized creature each day, as long as the mulch is replenished on a regular basis. Any organic material may be ground up and put into the mulch, allowing the bearer to turn otherwise inedible plants, animals and even waste into a nutritious, if tasteless, meal. If not provided with organic material whatsoever for more than three days, the mushrooms perish and provide no further food."
83,"A stone tube containing a rolled canvas portrait of a seated medusa, hands demurely folded in her lap. A slight smile is on her lips, but the eyes have been burned out leaving only ragged holes in the canvas. The artist's name, signed in a bottom corner, is written in an unfamiliar script."
84,"A string of brightly colored glass trade beads, used as currency among the distant tribes of Raphsheba. Knowledgeable PC's will know that these beads are worth about ten pounds of rough salt."
85,"A sturdy dog collar fashioned from black leather with a series of sharp 2-inch spikes jutting out of it."
86,"A tailored vest of ^BrightColourTable^ silk, stitched with golden thread. It is plain yet obviously of good quality."
87,"A tapestry depicting a unicorn and an elf maiden in a forest at night."
88,"A ten-pound iron trade bar, marked with the runes of a dwarven mountain kingdom."
89,"A stringed instrument known as a Halfling Drawharp that is related to, and descended from, the fiddle. It is nothing more than a wooden plate mounted on a broom handle, with four strings of various length mounted over and through the plate. The instrument is played by sliding and twisting the plate up and down and along the broomstick, causing the strings to give off warbling tones that dance all along the scale with a speed that no other instrument can match."
90,"A thin copper belly chain dangling three malachite stones."
91,"A thumbnail sized, orange-pink, heart-cut gem as translucent as glass. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gem as garnet."
92,"A polished tin hand mirror with yellowing bone handle."
93,"A triangular-shaped stringed instrument known as a balalaika, adorned with painted flowers."
94,"A type of hand drum known as a bodhran with a curious drumstick. The drumstick is short, with heads on both ends, held in one hand and played so that each head strikes the drumhead in an alternating rhythm. This gives the bodhran a unique sound most other drums cannot achieve."
95,"A fragile parchment map showing a series of caves in a wooded valley. According to the map there is a small, flooded passage about ten feet long that leads to a hidden cove with its own air and emergency supplies."
96,"A worked black onyx gem with bands of white, roughly the size of a grown man's fist."
97,"An iron rail spike with arcane runes etched along its sides."
98,"Never-Dull Shears: A pair of scissors sized to comfortably fit a human hand, their blades about five inches long. The metal is clearly old, with tiny rust marks on them in places, but no corrosion or even dust has made its home on the cutting edges. On close inspection, the cutting edges appear honed to a razor keen gleam that has not faded or dulled with the passage of time."
99,"An empty scabbard with an intricate design etched into the leather. With enough study, it may be interpreted as a map that purports to leads to the location of the matching sword."
100,"A simple device, a thin, threaded metal bar with a small metal plug capping one end, known in roguish circles as a blossoming lockbreaker. When the plug is pushed forward, the metal bar widens and segments into narrow arching strips, the further forward the plug slides, the more the strips bow. When placed inside a lock and opened, the strips snap tumblers and jam needle traps. A bearer who uses a blossoming lockbreaker can disarm a lock's needle trap and jam a lock closed or open with an action equivalent to attacking, even if he is not proficient with thieves' tools. Repairing a lock that has been jammed with a blossoming lockbreaker requires 3d20 minutes by a person proficient in thieves' tools or tinkers tools. A blossoming lockbreaker is ruined after a single use."
