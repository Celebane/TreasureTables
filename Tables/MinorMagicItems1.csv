1,"Loaf of the Lazy: An inflatable metal packet etched with the symbol of a loaf of bread that occasionally expands and deflates as if breathing. If the packet is opened and filled with a handful of flour a cup of water and a pinch of yeast and placed in the sun for an hour, the packet will expand and can be opened to reveal a fully cooked loaf of bread. The packet can be used in this way once per day."
2,"Deadeye: A black eyepatch bearing the image of a grinning silver skull. When worn the bearer's uncovered eye takes on a milky white appearance as if it was blind. The bearer suffers disadvantage on any perception checks based on vision but gains advantage on any vision checks to notice, spot or recognize undead creatures, or signs of their passage."
3,A black headband that creates a single illusionary face of a human male over the bearer's face. The illusion shifts to match the bearer's expressions and movements but it is not infallible and a very perceptive creature can see through it.
4,A white headband that creates a single illusionary face of a human female over the bearer's face. The illusion shifts to match the bearer's expressions and movements but it is not infallible and a very perceptive creature can see through it.
5,"A fist sized lump of purple crystal. When the bearer is seriously injured and is near death, dying or bleeding out, they automatically stabilize and the crystal shatters becoming useless. When they awake they recall lingering near death and a figure in purple robes beckoning them back to the land of the living. —Note: The bearer automatically stabilizes meaning that they do not continue to lose hit points, make death saving throws or whatever other mechanic your game uses. Instead they remain unconscious but alive, until they are woken up or healed."
6,A green belt buckle in the shape of a fig leaf that makes the bearer's ears feel warm and tingly when a creature within 50 feet is talking about them.
7,"A hairpin made of jade shaped like a dragonfly that allows the bearer the ability to see through smoke, fog and mist within five feet."

19,"A small ^RandomColour^ handkerchief that is capable of absorbing and holding four pints of fluid, it can be wrung out at any time to release the fluid."
20,Orb of the Night Watchman: A hollow metallic orb the size of a large marble that's etched with the symbol of an open eye. The orb begins to vibrate when tapped and stops when tapped again. While vibrating it prevents creatures within five feet from falling asleep naturally. Creatures kept awake by the orb gain no special benefits from not sleeping and suffer the usual penalties should they stay awake for long periods of time.
21,"Chasing Chair: A sturdy animated oaken chair that knows two commands: “Stay still” and “Follow me”, which is carries out to the best of its ability. It will flee from forces or situations that are actively damaging it but will not defend itself or attack in any way."
22,"A tarnished and blackened iron ladle that instantly purifies up five liters of water scooped up in it per day, but gives the water a harsh metallic taste that can't be masked by other flavors. The water treated by the ladle is considered sterilized as if it had been brought to an active boil for five minutes."
23,Hair of the Dog: A tarnished dented hip flask that fills with fair quality whiskey every morning at 6am. The alcohol completely disappears at 12pm every day if not consumed. Etched into the flask is the phrase “Hair of the dog”.

27,"An eyepatch crafted from cyclops hide. While worn, it grants the bearer the ability to see twice as far with the uncovered eye. However, the bearer loses all sense of depth perception and suffers disadvantage to hit on all ranged attacks."
28,"Leech Dust: A sealed glass vial filled with a blue-grey powder. Scattering this dust over a wound will sterilize the area and cause any poison trapped in the body to rise to the surface and be expelled, after which the wound closes slightly. Applying the powder takes one round and is an equivalent action to attacking or casting a spell. The recipient gains advantage on all checks to resist poison effects (Including damage) and if he is currently under the effect of ongoing poison damage he may make another check against it (As if he was attempting to resist it for the first time) with advantage. The recipient is also healed a single hit point. The dust's effects last for one minute and a creature cannot benefit from the dust more than once per hour. When found, the vial contains 5d4 doses of dust."
29,"Lenses of the Pyromage: A pair of clear glass and red leather goggles that allow the bearer to see perfectly through steam, smoke and heat wave distortion within 15 feet."
30,"Lion Gauntlet: An awkward fitting steel gauntlet bearing a well-crafted lion's head at the end in place of fingers. When the jaw hinge is opened from the inside, the gauntlet looses a convincing lion's roar that's as loud as ten grown men yelling. The hand inside the gauntlet can hold object clumsily but cannot wield weapon or perform delicate actions such as picking locks. The mitten-like armored glove require two hands and two rounds to properly don and strap into place before it can be used. Undoing the straps and removing it with one hand can be completed in one round which takes an action equal to attacking or casting a spell."
31,"Lure of the Lifeless, Detector of the Dead: An old bone ring with small chew marks marring its surface. If placed on a finger, the bearer immediately feels the hair on the nape of their neck rise as a cold shiver runs down their spine. Whenever the ring is worn, all intelligent undead within 100 feet become aware of the presence and location of the bearer and feel mildly compelled to seek the bearer out. After being worn for one hour, the ring allows the bearer to sense the presence and location of all unintelligent undead within 50 feet."
32,"Lush the Wineskin: A larger than average wineskin decorated with a humanlike face that has been imbued with a small measure of sentience. This barely intelligent item can speak common and has a vague sense of what's happening its general vicinity. It usually responds to the name “Lush” and introduces itself as such, seemingly unaware of the insulting connotation. Any wine stored in the skin will not spoil and stays fresh indefinitely. Lush refuses to be filled with anything other than some sort of fruit wine (Preferably grape) and spits out any other liquid immediately. The mouth of his face is also the spout of the skin, making drinking directly from the spout an awkward experience. Lush has a long history of experience with wine and can be convinced to render judgment or give a professional opinion on any wine he is filled with. This information grants proficiency and advantage to any checks involving; assessing how the wine was made, produced, stored, the conditions of the fruits growth, dryness, aftertaste and what food the wine would be well paired with. In short, Lush can function as a sommelier or wine steward, however he will only perform these duties when he contains a sample of the wine he is assessing. Lush can hold one gallon of liquid inside him and consumes one ounce of that wine per day which then disappears. Perhaps due to a fault of the enchantment or a quirk of the object, Lush seems to be personally effected by the alcohol he is filled with. In short, Lush is roaring drunk when he is full, begging for wine when he is low, hung over when he is empty and will drop into hibernation if the dry spell lasts more than three days and only awakes when completely refilled."
33,"Map of the Mind: A sturdy waterproof wooden map tube containing a rolled of sheet of blank canvas mapping. If a creature spends one minute concentrating on the canvas it becomes a topographical map of an area the user can picture. The map can display waterways and oceans, dungeons, underground tunnels etc. as well as above ground locations. The canvas is one and a half feet square and requires a full minute of uninterrupted concentration to make any changes to the map, therefore the larger the area displayed, the less detail is shown and the map cannot be zoomed in or out or panned around quickly to show more detail. The map only shows information that the creature remembers or knows and does not display anything that the user isn't aware of or cannot recall. —Note: I recommend having the user make a Knowledge Geography, Memory, Intelligence or other similar check to determine the map's quality. For example the user could use the map to display the layout of their house perfectly but might struggle to properly display a building they visited once a year ago. Based on the result of the check the DM can rule that the map is incomplete, not to scale, has incorrect door, wall or room locations or is otherwise inaccurate."
34,"Map of the Trail: A sturdy waterproof wooden map tube containing a rolled of sheet of blank canvas mapping. If a creature spends one minute concentrating on the canvas it becomes a topographical map of the last five miles the creature has traveled while carrying the map on their person. The map displays only sights and areas that the bearer has seen (It does not display unexplored caves, secret entrances, hidden chambers, etc.) and shows the exact path of the bearer has taken in their last five miles."
35,"Master's Ring: A heavy steel ring prominently displaying a luscious blood ruby. The bearer of the ring never fully relaxes and experiences a faint but constant feeling the back of their mind that someone is out to get them. The ring causes a faint tingling sensation and glows dimly whenever one of the bearer's employees, servants or hirelings is actively planning to betray him in some way. The ring must be worn for one week before the bearer benefits from the warning tingling and glow."
36,"Midwife's Intuition: A white gold disc on a silver chain. A creature holding the necklace begins to feel vaguely nauseous and occasionally feels a weak kick originating from their abdominal region. If the disc is held dangling in the air, it spins rapidly and glows when a pregnant humanoid is within 30 feet. It glows green for girl, orange for boy and yellow should there be more than one humanoid fetus within 30 feet."
37,"Money Belt: An ornate belt pouch with a gold insignia displaying the holy symbol of the God of trade. The pouch is magically linked to the heavenly depository of the God of trade, whose celestial bankers will act as money changers for the bearer of the pouch. The bankers will only accept and provide legal denominations and will not take clipped, shaved, counterfeit or otherwise illegitimate currency. The pouch can be filled up with any amount of currency that the pouch will hold (Up to ten pounds or half a cubic foot of material.) and be used to change the denominations. To activate, the pouch must be tapped three times and the bearer must verbally announce how much change is required and in what denominations. After activation, the new money instantly replaces the old, if the volume and weight of the new currency would be contained by the pouch, otherwise nothing happens. The pouch charges 5% of the total money changed as a “convenience fee” each time it is used."
38,"Nature's Benevolent Bounty: A ring made of living wood etched with plant designs. While worn, the bearer is imparted with the knowledge if natural vegetation, fungi, animals and insects found in the wilderness is edible or not. The wielder must be within five feet of said material in order to determine if consuming it would harm him. The ring must be worn for at least 24 hours before the bearer can benefit from it."
39,"Pillow of the Sleepless Fey: A comfortable pillow which appears to be designed for a child. Stitched into one side is the name Nodwick. If a creature sleeps upon this pillow during the night, small fairies will come to him and will extract 1d6 teeth while the user sleeps. The miniature fey will sprinkle generous amount of fairie dust in the user's mouth which instantly heal the wounds and take away all pain associated with the process. Upon awakening, the user is filled with a supernatural vitality which causes him not to require any sleep or rest for a number of days equal to the number of teeth lost plus one. If the fey are prevented from removing the teeth for any reason, the user is not affected by the fairie dust and does not receive any benefits."
40,"Pouch of the Dead-Lights: A crudely stitched together sack made of a pale leather, containing necromantic fireflies that have been enchanted to breed endlessly, causing the pouch to be constantly filled with glowing undead insects in varying stages of development. They reproduce quickly enough that a handful of fireflies can be released each day. The insects will follow and swarm around the creature who released them, shedding light equivalent to a candle. The user is not able to actively control the fireflies and the necromantic magic fades after one hour causing them to die permanently. After it's used, the bag must be provided a handful of raw material (snails, worms, meat, sugar, nectar, other insects, etc.) to replace the lost bio-matter, otherwise the fireflies will not be able to breed enough to be released again."
41,"Ring of Lifesense: A large oval shaped ring made of an unknown orange stone that fits over two adjacent fingers when worn. While worn, the bearer can take a moment to concentrate on a creature within 15 feet of themselves and instantly determine if that creature is alive or dead."
42,"Sailor's Pet: A life sized driftwood carving of a seagull with pearls for eyes, and wings made of sparkling layered oyster shells. It smells faintly of a fresh sea breeze and emits the faint sound of lapping waves and crying gulls. If completely submerged in saltwater for one uninterrupted hour, it will become animate when exposed to air and woodenly mime typical bird movements and gain the ability to fly. It's flight speed, strength, land movement and maneuverability are the same as a typical seagull and will follow the mental commands of the creature that removed it from the water. The carving returns to an inanimate state if it strays further than 100 feet from the creature that removed it from the water or until one hour passes. It is not intelligent and cannot communicate in any way, interact with objects, or provide any form of assistance in combat. Its structure is slightly more durable than the sum of its parts and easily resists damage from harsh winds, water and salt but is easily destroyed by mundane means such as hammers or fire."
43,"Spiny Coppers: A thick leather sack dotted with small pinpricks containing a dozen ordinary looking copper coins. The coins bear the standard marking and denominations for the area; however, a perceptive PC will notice a barely perceptible symbol of a caltrop etched in a discrete area. When the command word is spoken, all the Spiny Coppers within earshot sprout a multitude of tiny blades and spikes, which damages containers and slices up flesh. Coins held in hand or pressed against skin deal 1 point of damage to the bearer and damages coins pouches, clothing and other objects as normal. The blades and spikes can be ordered to extend once per round and remain extended for one minute or until ordered to retract. The coins function perfectly well as caltrops when activated."
44,"Stalker's Looking Glass: A small leather purse containing two hand mirrors which are identical except that one has the symbol of an open eye etched into its backing while the other has a closed eye in the same place. While the mirrors are within 50 feet of each other, looking through the mirror of the closed eye will show everything that its twinned mirror is currently reflecting. During that time looking through the mirror of the open eye reveals nothing but a normal reflection. When they are more than 50 feet apart both objects simply act as regular mirrors."
45,"Strike Anywhere Ring: An iron ring set with a square shaped red crystal, filled with swirling black smoke. When worn the bearer will emit the faint but constant smell of wood smoke wherever they go. After one day of wear, the finger upon which the ring resides will turn blackened and charred as if seriously burned. This causes no pain or damage and does not restrict the finger's movement or dexterity in any way. After this change, the blackened finger can be dragged against stone, metal or dry wood to create a shower of sparks as if tinder and flint was used. The sparks cause no damage to the bearer but can be used to start fires. If the ring is removed, the finger instantly reverts to its normal look and ceases to create sparks."
46,"Stylus of Fading Sight: A small writing stylus made from the oversized hyoid horn (Tongue bone) of a giant chameleon. When held, the bone's coloration slowly shifts to better match the hand of whoever holds it. The stylus turns any ink it is used to write with into invisible ink which blends into the paper. The invisible ink can only be seen under specific circumstances such as the low heat of a candle flame or a light sprinkling of vinegar or similar mildly acidic liquid."
47,"The Foghorn of Fog: A brass signal horn decorated with clouds and rolling fogbanks engulfing grassy fields. A creature can take a deep breath and blow into the horn, taking an action equivalent to making a weapon attack or casting a spell. When used, the horn bellows a deep rumbling bass tone like a ship's foghorn that can be heard up to a mile. Along with the sound, a cloud of fog comes out of the horn and completely obscures a ten-foot radius around the user. The cloud last for 12 seconds but can be renewed by blowing the horn again which also recreates the sound. The fog dissipates quickly if the horn is not blown again and can also be blown away by strong winds or burned off by large sources of fire. You get the feeling there was a breakdown in communication somewhere in the creation of this item about what its exact function was supposed to be."
48,"The Wigmaker: A fist sized blue ceramic sphere that when touched, instantly causes all the creature's hair and fur to fall off their body. The process is painless and the shed hair is not damaged in the process. The newly bald creature will regrow all the shed hair to exactly as it was before the next time they get a full night's rest. The regrowth process will leave the creature weakened, causing them to require twice as much food and water and to feel exhausted as if they had received no sleep at all. This weakened state lasts for the remainder of the day after the creature wakes and fades after another full night's rest. The object requires a 72 hour recharge period after being activated wherein it can be handled safely and cannot be activated."
49,Vestal's Ward: A pristine white marble statuette of a woman in religious garb that emits a red pulsing light with the intensity of a candle when a creature within 30 feet experiences thoughts of a sexual nature.
50,"Wand of Frog Touch: A large desiccated frog lashed to a wooden stick with sinew cord. This bizarre wand can be used as a spell focus for magical abilities. Once per day while casting a spell, the wielder may instill a portion of his life force into the dried amphibian (Which deals one hit point of damage per character level to the wielder or 10% of the wielder's maximum health or other equivalent amount) to animate and a deliver a spell that requires physical contact with the target. The frog moves up to 15 feet to reach the target and uses the wielder's statistics to determine if the touch spell is successful. If the frog takes any damage or is unsuccessful for any reason the spell is lost and the frog is immediately destroyed and reappears the next day on the wand. If the dried creature is successful, it dissolves in a haze of light thematically appropriate for the type of spell cast and reappears on the wand the next day."
51,"Wand of Phenomenal Pheromonal Fragrance: A foot-long wand made made of a large insect antenna. When used, two smaller antennae come out of the wand and feel up a nearby object. After retreating back into the wand the user gains sense of smell of the object as if they had put their face right up to it and inhaled deeply. The user gains advantage on perception checks based on taste and smell."
52,"Ring of Dizzying Sight: A polished hematite ring covered in miniature eyeballs which are constantly looking in all directions. One minute after donning the ring, the bearer's field of vision widens to the extremes as he gains 360-degree vision allowing the user to see things behind him just as easily as objects directly in front of him. Creatures attacking the bearer while in flanking positions gain no special attack bonuses, as the creature is able watch them all simultaneously. Due to a faulty enchantment, an inexperienced artificer or simple oversight, the ring does not grant the bearer the needed sensory processing power to deal with the all-round vision. The bearer will suffer from vertigo, dizziness, and faint nausea on a near constant basis and will find it quite difficult to remain properly balanced. If the bearer moves more than half of his regular move speed he loses his equilibrium and falls prone. Should the ring be removed, the bearer's sight instantly returns to normal however, he continues to suffer the vertigo and reduced speed for one minute while he readjusts to the change in visual perception. —Note: For example, if the bearer could move up to 30 feet in a round, he falls prone after moving 15 feet. A character who sacrifices other actions to gain more movement can take that movement but it would still be halved. For example, the bearer could move 15 feet then sacrifice his ability to attack this round (Gaining 30 feet of movement) and move another 15 feet."
53,Trick Rope: An ordinary looking 15 foot length of hemp rope that will instantly release itself from every knot that it's been tied in when fingers are snapped within earshot of it.
54,"A single silky red glove that feels strangely warm to the touch. While worn, the gloved fingers and thumb can be rubbed together causing the entire glove to glow, creating light equivalent to a candle. The light persists as long as the bearer continues to rub the fingers together."
55,"Divine Augury: A silver coin whose one side shines brightly and displays the image of an angel rising above the clouds, its hands raising up the souls of the worthy to the heavenly gates, with a prayer written in celestial engraved along the edges. On its opposite side, the coin is blackened and charred and sports the image of a demon torturing a soul in hell with a curse written in demonic engraved along the edges. One per day, a creature may flip the coin while considering a specific course of action (The player must disclose this idea to the DM) that the user plans to take within the next 30 minutes. If the course of action will likely provide good results, the angelic side lands heads up. If the course of actions will likely end badly, the demonic side lands face up. If the specified course of action is too vague, would end in mixed results or results that aren't especially good or bad the coin has an equal chance of landing on either side. Furthermore, there is a 5% chance that the coin fails to function at all and simply lands randomly. The creature has no way of confirming if the coin functioned correctly or gave them a random result based on mixed results, vague information or simply failed to function. —Note: The good or bad results only concern the user, therefore if the course of action would lead to an ally losing a hand but the user gaining 100 gold the result would be “good”."
56,"Caduceus of Triage: A shining silver medallion displaying two snakes entwined around a winged staff. When worn, the bearer becomes instinctively aware of any creature within 15 feet of him that is suffering from mundane sickness, disease, poison, parasites, fractures or other serious medical condition. The bearer does not learn of the specific issue or number of issues the creatures may have or how to treat them. If the bearer spends a moment to concentrate on the medallion, he may determine which creature within 15 feet of him is in the greatest need of medical attention. The medallion's magic will only function if the bearer has not harmed an intelligent creature within the last 24 hours."
57,"Warning Wyrm: A hand sized dragon statuette made of interwoven wicker vines, with eyes fashioned from glass marbles. When within one mile of a living dragon, the statuette's eyes glow brightly in a color that matches the scales of the nearest dragon."
58,"Screaming Skull: A small white rubber ball in the shape of a human skull. Five seconds after being squeezed the orb will produces various terrified screams which seem to be originating from a constantly changing assortment of men, woman and children. The screaming randomly alternates in intensity, pitch, number of voices and emotional terror for a total of one minute, at which point it falls silent. The skull can be used one per hour and can be thrown immediately after it's squeezed."
59,"Love Potion: A small sealed glass vial labeled “Bottled Love” with the instructions “One drop per draught of ale” written in feminine looping script along the side. The smell of the clear liquid inside is tempting but quickly becomes overpowering sweet. When consumed, the liquid acts as an intoxicant and aphrodisiac while generally lowering the drinker's inhibitions. A creature who consumes the liquid, suffers disadvantage on any checks to perceive that a creature or situation is dangerous, means them harm or is intending to trick or take advantage of them in some way. Furthermore, creatures gain advantage on diplomacy, persuasion, seduction or other social checks while attempting to convince the victim to do something if the act is not obviously dangerous or lethal. The love potion does not cause any slurred speech, dizziness, blurred vision or other symptoms associated with drunkenness. Those who consume the potion are much more receptive to taking actions or making decisions they would not normally make, however they are fully cognizant of their actions and would not violate their core ethical or moral beliefs without extreme need. The potion takes effect immediately after being consumed and its effects last for one hour. When found, the vial contains enough liquid to dose 5d4 creatures."
60,"Bloodfeeder's Bane: A chain necklace on which is strung a consecrated silver vial bearing the holy symbol of the God of ^GoodDomains^. The vial is filled with the preserved blood of a vampire and stoppered with the bone of a saint whose life's work was the destruction of undead that feed on the living. When worn, the vial imparts the bearer a sense of righteousness and a desire to destroy undead, especially vampires and their unholy spawn. All undead creatures who feed on the flesh or drink the blood of the living (Or consume the recently dead) suffer disadvantage on attacks against the bearer. The bearer must be good aligned to receive this protection and instantly lose the effect should they ever knowingly align themselves, work for, associate or consort with undead creatures."
61,"Creeping Claw: A dried goblin's hand bearing wickedly sharp claws. A large steel chain link penetrates the base of palm and is attached to a 30-foot length of hempen rope. A creature can cover the hand in their own freshly shed blood (Causing 1 hit point of damage) which causes the hand to animate. The creature can then mentally control the severed limb and command it to move and interact with objects. The hand walks on the tips on its fingers and can move up to 15 feet a round or climb five vertical feet per round by digging its claws into surfaces. The hand can perform simple tasks, can exert ten pounds of force and is as dexterous as the creature controlling it. The hand remains animated for five minutes at which point it requires new fresh blood to function."
62,"A jagged, foot-long flint wand that can be activated to create a candle sized flame to alight on its tip. The fire can be sustained for up to a minute or suppressed at any time. The wand can be activated once every ten minutes."
63,"A single, thick, beeswax candle that will burn forever without being consumed. It can be doused and relit as often as desired. The scented candlewax never loses its heady aroma of warm beeswax and honey."
64,"Dwarvish Translator: A tough granite stein carved with images of feasting dwarves. A creature holding the stein feels the urge to drink, shout, and start needless arguments with anyone taller than them. Any liquid drunk directly from the stein is treated as if it had twice its actual alcohol content. A drunk creature who holds the stein, can perfectly speak (But not understand) Dwarven as if they were a sober native speaker."
65,"Orb of Night: A dusky belt pouch containing a fist sized polished jet-black orb of perfect darkness that reflects nothing. If the orb is removed from the pouch, small flames of torch sized or smaller within five feet are extinguished, as their heat and light are sucked directly into the globe's inky darkness. After absorbing fire, the orb grows warm for one hour, during which time it is not able to absorb any sources of heat or light."
66,"Stationary Rod: A two-foot long flat iron rod with a button on one end. When the button is pressed, the rod becomes magically fixed in place and does not move (Even if it is defying gravity) until the button is pressed again. The rod can hold up to 20 pounds of weight. If the rod is subjected to more than 20 pounds of force while it is activated, it is moved along as if being dragged through the air until it comes to rest again."
67,"Mariner's Mask: A crude driftwood mask covered in scintillating fish scales. When a creature wearing the mask enters a body of water, small horizontal slits open on the bearer's neck. These openings cause no pain and upon close inspection resemble fish gills. While completely submerged in water, the bearer slowly absorbs oxygen through the underdeveloped gills, which supplement's the body's oxygen supply but cannot replace true breathing. The mask allows its bearer can hold their breath for five times as long as normal while completely submerged in water."
68,"Miser's Coin: A standard gold coin that appears moderately worn as if it had been rubbed repeatedly or used as a worry stone. A creature can bind the coin to themselves by coating it in their fresh blood (Causing 1 hit point damage) which establishes a mental link to the coin and breaks the coin's link to its previous owner. A creature linked to the coin develops a mild compulsion to hoard gold and other precious currency and feels the urge to spend as little as possible in all situations. When linked to the coin and within 20 feet of it, the owner can sense its exact location and teleport the coin to his hand with a thought."
69,"Medallion of the Forked Tongue: An expensive looking amulet depicting a king cobra with its hood spread and maw open, bearing its hypodermic fangs and long forked tongue. At a glance, the serpent's body appears to be made of gold with a tongue made of silver and small rubies for eyes. Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the jewelry's very appearance is a lie and that it is actually comprised of highly polished brass, shiny tin and red tinted glass. The bearer of the amulet experiences the faint but constant urge to lie whenever they speak and experiences a fleeting euphoric sensation whenever they are intentionally dishonest. It is not uncommon for even the most honest of bearers to become pathological in their misrepresentation of the truth, uttering white lies, half-truths and lies of omission as they become addicted to the short-lived euphoria. Twice per day the bearer can call upon the medallion's power allowing him to tell a lie without making any kind of verbal tells or physical ticks, granting the bearer advantage on a single bluff, deception or lie check."
70,"The Sound of Friendship: A sparkling silver whistle strung on a white silken cord. When blown, the whistle's piercing report can be clearly heard up to a quarter-mile away by creatures the user considers allies. All other creatures are completely unable to hear the whistle."
71,"Ring of Roguish Hearing: An obsidian ring that when worn, allows the bearer to understand Thieves' Cant, the secret language of rogues, criminals, charlatans and the seedy underbelly of society. The bearer is not granted the ability to speak, read or write in this language and the ring does not offer any aid to learning the language, as the words are automatically translated into a language the bearer understands. —Note: If your campaign setting doesn't have an official language like Thieves' Cant, you can allow the bearer to understand all criminal, shady, illegal slang or lingo in regards to crimes, drugs, black market services, etc. The slang is then automatically translated into words, terms and sayings the bearer understands."
72,"Ring of Roguish Tongue: An obsidian ring that when worn, allows the bearer to speak Thieves' Cant, the secret language of rogues, criminals, charlatans and the seedy underbelly of society. The bearer is not granted the ability to understand, read or write in this language and the ring does not offer any aid to learning the language, as the bearer hears the words he speaks in his native tongue. —Note: If your campaign setting doesn't have an official language like Thieves' Cant, you can allow the bearer to be able to speak using criminal, shady or illegal slang or lingo in regards to crimes, drugs, black market services, etc."
73,"Reflections of Vanity: A palm sized compact mirror in a circular silver case. A creature holding the object can utter the command phrase “Mirror, mirror” which causes it to grow or shrink as the user chooses. The silver case liquefies and flows into its new shape, stretching or condensing the mirror's reflective surface forcing it into the alternate form. The mirror is perfectly reflective and seems to possess a deep quality as if viewer were staring into a deep body of water rather than a thin sheet of glass. The mirror has four different shapes: A palm sized compact, a hand mirror, a square mirror one-foot-wide and a full length mirror five feet tall by two feet wide. The square mirror naturally floats in the air at face level facing the creature that activated it, while the full length mirror floats three inches off of the ground. Both can be commanded to hover in any place or face in any direction within five feet of the user and neither can hover while supporting additional weight. The mirror reverts back into its compact form and places itself safely on the ground if it strays more than five feet from its user, the user goes more than one minute without looking at his reflection or if it is physically harmed. Should the mirror be damaged, it instantly curls and retracts back into its compact form like an injured animal and refuses to open or shift forms for one week."
74,"Spoon of Desperation: A chipped wooden spoon bearing a single arcane rune meaning “Edible”. When tapped on an inert organic or semi-organic material (wood, dirt, bone) the spoon transmutes that matter into edible foodstuffs. The transmuted material is nutritious enough to serve as food but will be mushy, unpalatable and look and taste strongly of the original material. The spoon can transmute enough material (Roughly one pound) to feed one adult human per day."
75,"Amulet of Hope: A crudely made child's poppet made mostly of string, twigs and snatches of faded fabric. The poppet has been infused with the pure, unadulterated optimism of the child that put it together. A creature wearing the amulet feels as though there are always positive solutions to problems and that if they try their hardest they can always succeed. The toy feels warm to the bearer's touch and hums a reassuring nursery rhyme when held. If there are no other sources of light, the amulet will glow with a warm golden light that is as bright as a candle. Whenever the bearer rolls a natural 1 on a save to resist fear or terror effects, he may roll again and use the new result. The amulet displays none of these effects and appears completely mundane to a bearer who has ever deliberately killed a humanoid child."
76,"Specter's Top: A child's spinning top made of pristine white bone. A few well-placed holes have been drilled through the toy, causing it to make a mournful haunting sound when in use. If spun, the top will continue to rotate indefinitely if there are any incorporeal or invisible undead within 50 feet. If there are no such creatures within the radius, the top stops spinning and falls normally."
77,"Colorthief's Brush: An ornate mahogany and horsehair paintbrush bearing a silver needle on its back. To activate the brush's magic, it must be instilled with a portion of a living creature's essence by jabbing them with the needle, dealing 1 hit point of damage. The brush becomes magically self-cleaning and creates its own paint for one hour after activation at which point it requires more life essence. While it is activated, the user can prick the needle into any object which leeches away some of the object's vibrancy causing it to become slightly greyer. This causes the brush to create paint of the exact same shade as the pricked object. The brush can only store one shade of paint at any time, and loses the color once it becomes inactive."
78,"Chest of the Mundane: A battered looking oaken chest, half a cubic foot in size. It's locking mechanism while serviceable is easily picked or jimmied. Any object placed the chest is covered with illusionary magic that causes it to appear worthless, plain or boring. Gold coins turn to copper, porcelain vases turn to clay, bolts of silk turn to wool and precious gemstones turn to sparkly rocks.

An object must remain in the chest for five minutes before the magic takes effect and remains masked by the illusion for one minute after being removed from the chest."
79,"A delicate bracelet consisting of a dozen beads of rose quartz on a silken cord. The gemstones glow as bright as a candle for a few seconds in a soft pink hue, whenever a magical spell is cast within 30 feet of them."
80,"Master's Needles: An ornate tattooing kit complete with a variety of needles and inks. When the needles are used to ink a tattoo, the image becomes animate on the recipient's skin and has limited mobility. The image can be set to go through a visual loop of a maximum of one minute and cannot move more than the length of it's radius from the centermost point of the tattoo. For example, a ten-inch-wide tattoo of a clock face could count from one to 60 on a loop and move five inches from the center point of the face. However, a demon fighting a angel that takes up the user's entire back could have a repeating minute-long fight that crosses the user's entire body. All of these conditions are set mentally by the tattooist at the time of creation and cannot be changed short of dispelling magic, flensing the skin or altering it with a similar magic tattoo kit. Creating a tattoo this way takes three times as long as normal and requires the tattooist's full mental concentration."
81,Hornet Ring: A gaudy brass ring stamped with the symbol of an angry hornet in flight. Its bearer to deliver a startling (But non-damaging) shock to a creature the bearer is physically touching.

Furthermore the user gains the ability to perform various alcohol related mixing, pouring, stacking, and juggling tricks flawlessly regardless of their individual dexterity or ability. Although practical limitations such as missing fingers or hands may stop the tricks from going smoothly. However, these abilities are not without limitation: While connected to the bartender's soul, the user is must remain silent and only able to grunt or ask generic stock questions such as “what will it be?” “What are you having?” or “What's your poison?”. The user must fill any drink order requested of them to the best of his ability and pay the utmost attention to his client's drunken ramblings. If the user isn't actively making a drink, he will unconsciously use the Rag to clean the nearest available cup, mug, glass or whatever flat surface is currently passing for a bar. If the user fails in any of these tasks, he is immediately stricken with the worst hangover of his life which gradually fades of the next 24 hours. The user may not establish a connection to the Rag again for seven days after failing to follow the Rag's rules.

86,"Bowl of the Efficient Traveler: A medium sized soup cauldron made of porcelain, that more resembles a chamber pot than a cooking implement. Whenever solid humanoid waste is placed in this container, it will instantly become a delicious and fortifying stew, which covers all of a humanoid's nutritional needs and is also quite slimming. Invaluable on a long trip….or it would be if anyone could bring themselves to eat the stuff."
87,"Cleaning Rag: A small patch of greyish rag that has been imbued with the power to clean surfaces of dust and light debris on its own. If the user places the fabric on an object and utters the command word “Clean” and then the name of the object, the rag starts to clean until the item is free of dust and debris at which point it falls to the ground."
88,"Chalice of Profane Communion: An ornate iron chalice bearing the holy symbol of the God of ^EvilDomains^. If a creature holds the chalice while praying earnestly to that God for one minute, any liquid the vessel contains becomes cursed with divine energy.

90,"Coin of The Dead: A large copper penny with a prayer for the dead etched into both of its sides. A creature can use this coin to send a message to the soul of a loved one who has passed away. The user must place one hand on the deceased creature while holding the coin in their other hand and recite its prayer out loud while focusing on a strong personal memory of the dead creature. This process takes one uninterrupted minute. After this the user must place the coin under their own tongue at which point they can compose a message of no more than five minutes in length. If done correctly, the creature's soul will receive the message in whichever afterlife it currently resides. If the prayer is said incorrectly or if the user has no strong personal memories of the deceased, (DM's discretion) the coin fails to function. The coin does not display any kind of sign or signal should the process succeed or fail. The coin can be used multiple times per day but a user can never send a second message to a creature they have already contacted or tried to contact."
91,"Comb of Style: A shimmering comb made of polished horn, which gleams in even the faintest light.

While inside the pouch, the candies do not melt or spoil, remaining fresh as if they were just made. If a type of natural, nontoxic fruit or edible plant material (Seeds, leaves, pieces of fruits, bark, etc) is placed into the otherwise empty pouch, that object will disappear and be replaced by candies of that plant's flavor at dawn. If no material is placed inside, the pouch fills itself with a dozen candies of a single random flavor (See notes). The gummies transform into fertile soil 24 hours after being removed from the pouch if not consumed. If the pouch has candies in it from previous days, it will top itself up so that there are a maximum of 12 gummies inside. The pouch does not generate candy if it's bearer has killed an animal for sport, pleasure or monetary reward in the past week. —Note: Roll to determine the random flavor, OR the pouch can cycle through the flavors daily: 1 Orange, 2 Apple, 3 Cherry, 4 Grape, 5 Maple, 6 Blackberry, 7 Peach, 8 Lemon, 9 Strawberry, 10 Blueberry, 11 Mint, 12 Licorice."

The tube will clear clear the air of smoke, stale or musty air, foul smells, spores, toxins, poisons and other airborne nuisances in an enclosed room no more than 30 by 30 feet, in one minute's time. At the end of the minute after the tube has cleared the air, all creatures in the area have advantage on any saving throws or checks made to resist the effects of airborne pathogens, poisons, toxins or other effects.

Inside is an skeletal mouse whose bones are covered in arcane unmelting ice. The undead mouse will follow whoever carries the pouch, as well as following the bearer's basic commands. The mouse understands its bearer's spoken words but cannot speak or understands the words of other creatures and is only as intelligent as a particularly smart mouse.

99,"Hag Finger: A shriveled green finger that is warm to touch and covered in a thick layer of perpetual slime and algae. The finger once belonged to a type of malevolent fey known as a hag and the digit retains the faint memories of its full form. A creature can place the finger in their mouth and suck on the toxic slime which infuses their body with illusionary magic. A few moments after swallowing the virulent algae, the magic causes the user to look like a bent old woman with matted white hair, sinewy arms and rotted green teeth. The use of the finger comes with some practical limitations as it must remain in the user's mouth constantly while the slime is consumed or the magic instantly fails. This makes it quite difficult to speak properly and nearly impossible to cast spells that require verbal components. The user suffers disadvantage on any checks requiring fluent speech (Such as diplomacy, singing, bluff or some intimidation checks) and a 75% chance that a spell requiring speech will fail. Furthermore, whenever the user first places the finger in their mouth and after every ten minutes of constant use, the user suffers 1 point of poison damage as the toxic algae enters their system."
100,"House Helper: A one-foot tall wooden statuette expertly carved and painted to look like a maid.

The figurine can only be given one task at a time and works diligently on whatever its last command was. The statuette can exert up to 20 pounds of force but cannot under any circumstances, directly or indirectly cause harm to a creature. If multiple House Helpers are given the same goal they will actively work together to achieve it."
