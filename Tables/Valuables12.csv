6,"A ^RandomMusicalInstruments^ of masterwork quality that produces absolutely perfect music. Its sound has a pure, almost ethereal quality, as if the instrument creates the very idea of music rather than a just organized sound."
7,"A cedar box holding ten ounces of frankincense."
8,"A powerful reliquary created from the dried heart of a ^Humanoid^ who died performing a heroic deed. It rests in a plain pine box and wrapped in homespun linen and would be extremely valuable to priests of the divine concept of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ or to clerics who directly oppose that ideal."

54,"Wand of Dueling Shadows: An ebony wand of an impossibly dark shade of black that casts no shadow of its own. A creature wielding the wand can cause the shadows of two creatures within 30 feet to animate and attack each other. The shadows gain definition and shading, seemingly almost alive and fight as if their owners were engaging in a melee combat with the equipment and skills (Including feats and daily powers or abilities, none of which are actually expended) the owners possess. Eventually the shadow belonging to the better fighter will win, beating the other shadow into shapeless blackness which returns to take its place in its owner's shade. The victorious shadow gloats and celebrates as befitting its owner's personality, then returns to its proper place. Neither owners are harmed in any way, and feel no discomfort or pain as their shadows beat each other senseless. The wand can be used once per minute and multiple wands can be used in conjunction with each other to create team fights or all out shadow brawls. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize items like these as a way of settling disputes and wagers of who's the better fighter without causing any actual bloodshed and can often be found in wealthier taverns as a form of entertainment and spectator sport. —Note: To settle who wins, both creatures can roll for combat as if the characters were actually fighting. If two NPC's are fighting, the DM can choose to roll, flip a coin or arbitrarily decide a winner. If the wand is creating a significant amount of unnecessary shadow combat, when PC's are involved both characters can roll one set of attack and damage rolls and whoever gets the overall greater result wins."

78,"A toolkit that contains an adamantine file, an adamantine drill (With bits of varying sizes) and a small adamantine hacksaw. The tools are wrapped in a black leather script with the words “UNIVERSAL KEY” stitched on the inside flap in silver thread. The kit seems specifically designed to allow nonprofessionals to bypass locked doors and open locked chests, and the tools are simple and straightforward (If somewhat slow). The drill in this kit allow a character to bore a three-inch deep, half-inch-wide hole in any non-adamantine object in one full turn, while not otherwise moving or taking actions.  This is often sufficient to remove the locking mechanism from a door or container. The bearer can use the hacksaw to cut through up to one inch of non-adamantine material as an action equivalent to attacking."

The sphere hovers above the staff, but moves with it as if affixed. It cannot be removed or parted from the staff. The wielder can cause the water inside the globe to move, swirl or spin as they will, freeze to ice or turn to steam. When not specifically directed, the water returns to its default swirling state."
99,"Wand of the Ethereal: A foot long wand composed of a single thin ray of mage-light. The slender wand can trace patterns and signs in the air which linger as cold blue light for one minute before fading completely. A dexterous wielder can draw complex pictures or write entire sentences in the air before the light begins to disappear."
100,"A pair of heavy iron manacles that appear wholly mundane but glowing red runes appear when they are placed on any creature who can cast spells. If the creature restrained by the manacles attempts to cast a spell, the manacles flare as bright as a torch for a few seconds."
