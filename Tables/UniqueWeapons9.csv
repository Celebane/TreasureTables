1,"An antique but serviceable battleaxe, well-rusted and probably taken from a barrow."
2,"An enormous knife with a fixed blade that is 32 inches from the slightly hooked, double-bladed tip to the end of the worn, ironwood handle. It has a steel crosspiece, with a dried bit of something (Probably blood) still caught in the joint. Carved into the bottom of the handle was a craftsman's mark with the name “Fles.” The dagger rests in an old leather sheath and if removed, the wielder will find the blade freshly sharpened and oiled."
3,"A sinister, scorpion-tail whip made of white ape skin with a hilt wrapped in lead wire."
4,"A dagger made from the tooth of a dead sandworm, a fearsome desert monstrosity. It bears a curved, double edged blade that is milky white in colour and iridescent. It is set on a black handle with deep finger ridges separated from the blade by a slim round ring instead of a shearing-guard."
5,"A club fashioned from a donkey's jawbone, still studded with teeth. It is said to have been wielded by a great warrior who slayed a thousand men."
6,"A knight's straight sword with plated with silver along its fuller. The wielder can take great advancing steps with this beautifully slender greatsword while making use of his bodyweight to inflict deadly strikes."
7,"A bamboo quarterstaff with a skeletal jackal head."
8,"A longsword with a hilt covered in lizard leather. At an inch above the guard is stamp in the shape of a sun with sixteen rays alternately straight and wavy, symbolizing the heraldry of sunlight and warmth from the sun. Two inches above the sun begins a beautifully engraved stylized inscription which reads ""Draw me not without reason; sheath me not without honour.”"
9,"A black leather bandolier containing two dozen throwing stars, pointed for penetration rather than bladed for blood, each set about a central ring weighted with lead."
10,"Liquid Blade: An inconspicuous palm sized metal tube that weighs two pounds. The bearer can empty the contents of the tube with a quick flick of the wrist (An action equivalent to drawing a weapon), causing the bubbling transparent liquid within to instantly solidify into a jagged crystalline blade. By holding the tube, the wielder can then use the weapon as if it were a fragile shortsword that has a 25% chance to shatter should the wielder get a natural 1 on an attack roll. The blade lasts for ten minutes, after which it evaporates, leaving nothing behind but the empty tube. The bearer can add one dose of poison to the liquid in the bottle at any time before the blade is unleashed, which acts like applying a dose of poison to a weapon but the toxin remains wet and viable until the blade crystalizes. When the liquid turns into a solid blade, the weapon includes one application of that poison. When the blade evaporates, any unused poison does so as well. The tube and its liquid contents are an alchemical creation, containing no magical enchantments."
11,"A blowpipe consisting of an ornate copper viper wrapping around a deep brown oaken pipe."
12,"A broad axe (Battleaxe statistics) consisting of a stout pole four feet in length ending in a single-edged, trumpet-shaped blade mounted on one end. This axe is a footman's weapon, giving the soldiers a longer reach and a fighting chance against mounted opponents. Its long handle allows the wielder to put considerable force into his swing. Despite the shaft length, the broad axe is a one-handed weapon."
13,"A ceremonial ^RandomSwordTable^ with magical ornamentation and significance beyond its use as a mere weapon. Interestingly enough judging by its wear and tear, it has seem much combat."
14,"A double-edged broadsword (Longsword statistics) with a blade of an unknown black metal. The hilt is wrapped in dark pebbled leather, and its pommel is a flat disk in which small glyphs are inscribed around a large onyx gemstone."
15,"A durable light crossbow with dwarven runes worked into its design. Knowledgeable PC's can discover that the runes are associated with a mountain clan that would probably enjoy seeing the weapon returned to their ancestral halls."
16,"A finely-crafted lightweight lance made of maple and tipped with steel."
17,"A flail that appears neglected and ill-used, despite being in peak condition. The weapon's grip is wrapped in tattered grey cloth."
18,"A formerly fancy dagger. The hilt was fine ivory carved in the shape of a maiden, but someone gouged out the eyes and stained the dress with what appears to be blood."
19,"A fullblade with a blue tinge on one half of the blade and a polished bronze appearance on the other side. The blue half bears a single, inexplicably sharp edge while the bronze side duller but jagged and serrated, appearing the most dangerous of the two. The grip is wrapped with studded leather, and the pommel it set with a luscious sapphire."
20,"A gleaming greatsword with black crystal decorating the otherwise simple guard. The image of a raven in flight and a trail of its feathers is etched into the flats of the blade. As the blade moves, the raven seems to flap its wings, never quite still, but never leaving the blade."
21,"A goblin made sickle with a rusted, dirty blade covered in old blood and bits of gore."
22,"A greataxe fashioned from the tooth of a kraken and is steeped in the magic essence of the ancient leviathan."
23,"A greatclub of bent mahogany, shod in steel. The metal is in etched in a spiraling, serpentine design that confuses the eye."
24,"A greatsword with a dark, shiny blade like polished wet flint, with a curious and vaguely cruciform groove in the pommel that runs up and onto the blade."
25,"A greatsword with a rune-inscribed blade of adamantine, a leather wrapped oak handle, and a steel ring pommel."
26,"A huge warhammer comprised of a thick length of wood a stride long with a scarred lump of iron the size of a brick for a head."
27,"A jagged shard of obsidian embedded in the bone of an unknown creature, bound with simple leather. The primeval handaxe sends a shiver down the wielder's spine when touched."
28,"A longspear made of intricately carved wood, with an impossible array of weaving vines that twist chaotically, often doubling back on one another with no discernable pattern."
29,"A longsword with a narrow length of bright steel chased with swirly silver patterns that glow white. When swung, lines of glowing tracery appear in its wake, leaving patterns hypnotic neon tracks in the air."
30,"A mace consisting of a stout wooden haft topped by a metal striking head shaped like a clenched fist."
31,"A mage's quarterstaff made of burnt maple, shod with copper that's stained an ominous dark crimson. At the staff's apex rests a marble sized, floating sphere made of glowing ruby."
32,"A maul made of an unsmelted meteor and a finely worked, hardwood handle. The maul is heavy but very well balanced."
33,"A metallic spiked shield whose glittering outer surface is covered in gleaming specks of blue, purple, and red. The sparkling colors lie just below the weapon's surface, reflecting oddly in the light."
34,"A monstrous dagger made from the fang of some ungodly cross a shark's serrated tooth and the long canine of a great cat. The metallic edge, nicked and worn, appears, on some inspection, to be an extension of the tooth's root, as is the grip. There are holes and dents, thereupon, suggestion the iron itself was once fed by nerves and veins."
35,"A nearly incorporeal ^RandomSwordTable^. The translucent blade is shrouded in a black mist and extends outwards like a thin stream of smoke from the black leather hilt. Due to the nearly weightless blade, the weapon weighs only a single pound but the semi-tangible sword can never be coated in oils, poisons or alchemical materials of any sort."
36,"A newly made hand crossbow with a stock made of fir and a walnut bow. The stock has a depiction of the image of a lion within a circle."
37,"A pair of arctic hunting bolas made of leather straps with weights fastened to the end. Each bola has eight different weights made of egg-shaped, walrus ivory etched with the likenesses of birds in flight."
38,"A pair of finely tooled daggers with handles shaped like human women dancing. When sheathed together the handles interlock in an embrace that is not suitable for minors."
39,"A scimitar with a horned grip made of yellowed, human bone and a razor-sharp blade spattered with blood."
40,"A perfectly functional ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ crafted entirely from rock. Any cloth or leather elements are made instead of flexible mineral and studded with finely polished semi-precious stones."
41,"A perfectly functional ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that's always warm to the touch. Any metal parts are crafted from black iron and sigils of flames cover its surface. The weapon is primarily coloured various shades of red and orange."
42,"A pike made of a treant's arm that has a bark covered grip that has allegedly never slipped out of a wielder's hands."
43,"A pitch black halberd imbued with the captured terror of its victims. When wielded, the chillingly cold blade releases a baleful aura that makes weaker foes tremble in fear."
44,"A quarterstaff that appears to be a living redwood sapling. The staff is roughly two inches in diameter, and is six feet, two inches in height. It has several branches sprouting from the top eighteen inches, and each branch has several still living leaves. The bark is fairly smooth, but just below the branches there is four almost identical faces circumnavigating the staff. Each is the face of Chislev, Goddess of Nature. Each face represents a different aspect of her essence: The Creator, The Healer, The Defender, and The Destroyer. These faces, although clearly visible, appear to have grown naturally in the bark. The staff has no root system, but instead is capped with bog iron."
45,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a beautifully carved blade made of a greenish-blue crystal with an unfortunate fracture through the blade's length. The wielder is instilled with the feeling that the sword is the bane of wicked sorcerers everywhere."
46,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with gleaming blade and a crossguard design in the style of a pair of spread angel wings. The weapon radiates a sense of unused potential."
47,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ adorned with laws and rules in various languages, each of which details the exact standards and specifications of weapon design, construction and ownership."
48,"A rapier with a blade composed of narwhal tusk and a driftwood hilt displaying a scintillating fish scale grip. The basket is made of a large scallop shell, lashed to the driftwood with dried kelp. The weapon rests in a sheath made of a giant lobster's tail and shark leather, accented by a pair of eel skulls."
49,"A razor-sharp katana (Longsword statistics) with a blade of folded steel and a hilt wrapped in silver wire. The blade is decorated with elven runes that convey the meaning “Phantom of Wealth”. The pommel is in the shape of a perched falcon."
50,"A round, lightweight shield consisting of two antelope horns pointing in opposite directions connected by two crossbars which also acts as a handle. A wielder can tip the spiked shield forward and stab outward with the sharpened horns to wound the enemy. The crossbars are covered with a plate of steel and leather which allows the object to function as a means of protection."
51,"A scimitar finely engraved with strange words and glyphs that are barely visible in any light."
52,"A scythe with a handle of white ash, a blade of painted bone and bars carved into the centre of the blade to resemble the wall of a cage."
53,"A sheaf of five javelins that have throwing cords made of finely braided silver elven hair so reflective that they almost glow."
54,"A shortsword bearing runes acid burned into the blade that glow a dull blue when wielded. The hilt is ornate with two clear gems at the base of the blade on either side."
55,"A slim metal case containing a dozen beautiful, pearl-handled darts with sharpened emerald tips wrapped in a soft cloth."
56,"A simple and elegant sidesword (Shortsword statistics), with a silver guard and gold rivets on the pommel."
57,"A straight silver dagger of plain appearance until it is taken into hand by a good creature. Then, rainbow lights courses through the blade, and the weapon begins to toll gently, yet neither noise nor light betray the blade when stealth is required."
58,"A weathered battle pick that has seen more than its fair share of combat. Age hides the versatility and strength of its sharp point. Warriors of old used this weapon to destroy their foes, preying on the smallest weaknesses with cruel ease."
59,"A single edged longsword made of bleached and polished wood. Its hilt is decorated with alternating garnet and topaz stones. The blade is not perfectly straight, but follows a natural grain. Despite these irregularities, the sword has a razor-sharp leading edge."
60,"A sleek shortsword with a curving blade of a foreign and exotic design. Single-edged, the steel of the blade reflects light like the ripples of a pond. Down the blade's length on either side is etched a coil of twisting rose briars picked out in a deep jade green. The sword's hand-guard is a virtually nonexistent oval of unornamented gold, and the hilt is wrapped in braids of black silk shot through with golden thread. There is no appreciable pommel nut, the hilt ending in a plain frosted steel finial."
61,"A small, eerie dagger, made of bronze and flawless obsidian in the shape of a feather."
62,"A weighty rod (Heavy mace statistics) three feet in length and decorated across the surface with carved skulls and leering faces. These faces seem to subtly shift almost as if writhing in agony. Grey smokes exude from the top end constantly trailing down to the ground before vanishing. Anyone holding the rod feels a strange heat from it."
63,"A white silk bracer containing a half dozen crescent-shaped, silvered throwing knives, all with black leather handles fitted in the weapon's midsection."
64,"A wooden crate containing 32 crossbow bolts with shafts of oak wood in its natural color and fletching of blue-gray feathers."
65,"A wooden pike approximately seven feet in length, with one end sharp enough to impale an enemy. The other end has a slight crook in it, with a semi-transparent, colorless, and diamond-like stone embedded within the polearm. The weapon notably has several cracks in it, as if it was once shattered into many pieces and then made whole again."
66,"An ancient dagger whose blade and undulating hilt are fashioned from jet black obsidian stone, such that it reflects not a speck of light. The blade is strengthened and honed by rituals long forgotten, never losing its edge."
67,"An ancient stone warhammer carved with runes and weighs twice as much as it should."
68,"An elegant silver sword that when held by a magician, causes pale, almost transparent fire to burst harmlessly into life and play along the length of the blade. The light is surprisingly bright in eerie half-darkness, as if the sword had been dipped in brandy and touched with a match."
69,"An elegantly polished wooden greatclub, with mysterious, ever-changing glyphs swirling over its surface."
70,"An engraved light oaken shield studded with ironwood spikes. Ornamental vines are wound around the spikes, creating the appearance of a lethal briar patch."
71,"An entirely steel-wrought heavy crossbow, so large it's more like a small ballista. It uses a set of steel gears, cams and cranks to draw the firing string back. The firing beams are long and the weapon generally shaped like a large metal crucifix, symbolizing the torturous punishment for creatures who attempt to escape their mortality. Being hit by a bolt launched from this weapon feels like a strong man hit you full force with a heavy mace."
72,"An extremely corroded, rusty-looking greathammer with 'Crusty Jim' carved into the head."
73,"An intimidating longsword with multiple hooks, barbs, and serrations along the blade, excellent for catching and sundering a foe's weapon."
74,"An unusual looking shortsword, whose handle is longer than the actual blade. It sports a carved ivory skull on its pommel and a small gemstone on its guard that resembles an eye. Half of the blade is serrated on one edge."
75,"A venerable greatsword whose blade is fashioned from the shaved finger bone of a titan, with sharp bits of steel inlaid around the edge."
76,"A well-kept rapier with an insignia of a rose on the pommel with the knuckle guard, inner guard and loop being designed to look like a vine covered by thorns."
77,"A well-used, spiked chain made of high-carbon steel with grips of pebbled black crocodile skin."
78,"A whip created from braided local vines draped over an extraordinarily large chunk of rose quartz."
79,"A yellowed club made out of a ogre's twisted thigh bone."
80,"An abyssal forged dagger with a hilt of sculpted bone encrusted with a small green jewel. The blade is crude and worn, with the faint smell of sulfur, blood and ash emanating from it."
81,"An ancient knife with a simple leaf-blade design ending in a wooden handle wrapped in cord and leather. Its double edge blade is made of bronze and wickedly sharp, with a needle point. The point seems hungry…"
82,"An apprentice blacksmith's first sword made of shoddy pig iron. Although the ^RandomSwordTable^ is better than nothing, the weapon is uneven, heavy, poor quality and damn near as cheaply made as can be found."
83,"An elaborate knife carved with special barbs and grooves, meant to channel toxins into the victim's bloodstream."
84,"An elaborately styled bronze dagger with a handle uncomfortably inlaid with dozens of teeth. The blunt edge is nonetheless coated in sticky blood."
85,"A war pick adorned with blackened metal, inscribed with passages doubting and decrying the gods."
86,"A whip that appears to be made from braided feather down with a bird of prey's claw at the tip."
87,"A white composite bow of elven make that whispers in the wielder's ear “Swift death to my enemies” in elven whenever nocked."
88,"A wicked looking battleaxe in rough condition, though it was clearly once of fine quality. The weapon's short grip, geometric inlay, and wide-but-balanced head clearly mark it as dwarf made. The weapon's scarred handle, gruesome skull trophies, and notched and pitted blade, however, clearly marked it as goblin owned."
89,"A wicked, barbed trident of black iron and driftwood."
90,"A wooden quarterstaff nearly identical to a length of driftwood. Its dark color and cracked surface suggests that it is several hundred years old, at least. Druidic runes cover its surface, with the rune for “Purity” etched near the bottom. When the staff is near water, the runes begin to glow a pale yellow."
91,"An ancient dagger with a simple leaf-blade design with a wooden handle wrapped with cord and leather. Its double edge blade is made of bronze and wickedly sharp, shiny, with a needle point. The wielder occasionally gets the odd sensation that the weapon seems hungry…"
92,"An ebony halberd forged in the Nine Hells. It bears a fearsome aesthetic true to its inhuman origins, featuring a jagged, saw-like blade, glowing red filigree, and an overall design that blends rough organic curves with smooth, artificial edges."
93,"An imposing war fan (Greatsword statistics) that's really more of a steel rod with a large, flared blade at the end. The result is a somewhat difficult to use, but wickedly effective blade that hits with the full momentum of the swing, frequently decapitating opponents."
94,"An elegant shortsword in a wooden scabbard with silver fittings sculpted in floral shapes; on closer examination, many of the flowers contain small bees. The sword's handle is waxy to the touch, and fits comfortably in the hand."
95,"An elven greatsword whose blade is single-edged, slightly curved, with a polished finish and uniformly sharp. The hilt is long and the hand-guard is a circular plate."
96,"An impressive glaive, made of living ironwood, giving the blade a bright green appearance, while the bark covered shaft remains almost pitch black. Despite its wooden origin, its handle feels metallic"
97,"An irregular club that has always has a living leaf or three growing out of it. The wooden weapon somehow retains the resiliency and scent of a freshly cut branch."
98,"An octopus leather quiver containing a dozen harpoons (Javelin Statistics), each made of a gleaming, shining steel covered with a blue-white sheen like mother of pearl. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize the material as pearlsteel, a strange metal crafted by secretive merfolk metallurgists working near volcanic vents in the ocean floor. It is created from fine steel and rare silvery pearls found only in the ocean depths where the pressures alone would kill a land walker. Pearlsteel is highly prized by all undersea races as it slices more smoothly through the resistance that water presents."
99,"An ornate gold and mithril bastard sword. The hilt is wide and has a circular emblem in the center depicting a strange rune. The pommel of the sword has a large curved fire opal put into it. The blade is completely bare of ornamentation but appears to vary in color between gold and silver."
100,"A longsword with a slender, razor-edged, gleaming red blade, its length inscribed with designs of cloaked figures and tall scythes, accentuated by a black blood trough running along its center. The hilt appears whitened like bleached vertebrae and the pommel has a skull-bobbed design. Running from it toward the crosspiece, the hilt was carved to resemble a backbone and rib-cage, and the crosspiece itself resembles a pelvic skeleton, with legs spread out wide and bent back toward the head, so that the wielder's hand fits neatly within the bony boundaries. All of the pommel, hilt and crosspiece is white, like bleached bones, except for the eye sockets of the skull pommel, which seems like black pits at one moment and flares with red fires the next."
