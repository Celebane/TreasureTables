1,"A suit of ^RandomArmor^ armor that exudes a faint aura of protective abjuration magic as if it once held a defensive enchantment that has since faded."
2,"A suit of ^RandomArmor^ armor with a gorget that rise up at the back of the collar, protecting the top of the spine. The symbol of a brain is stamped into the back of the neckpiece's interior so that it touches the base of the wielder's skull. The armor seems to possess the faintest trace of self-awareness and the wielder can occasionally feel a subtle touch of another mind drift across his own. Knowledgeable PC's might conclude that the suit was once a truly sentient armor possessing true intelligence that it has somehow lost, died or gone into a state of hibernation."
3,"A suit of well-crafted ^RandomArmor^ armor fashioned from study components and arranged to better distribute the weight over the wielder's frame to make long distance travel easier.

5,"A set of ^RandomArmor^ armor that is completely devoid of any coat of arms or identifying standard.

8,"A fragile-looking suit of full plate that is actually quite stalwart. The armor is just ordinary (If heavily polished) steel covered in a thin layer of alchemically resilient glass. The silvery, transparent nature of the armor gives it a rather unusual look not unlike a mirror and some members of the nobility wear this armor simply as a fashion statement. The glass is incredibly durable and the armor is no stronger or weaker than a typical suit of full plate."

33,"A suit of ^RandomArmor^ armor trimmed in perpetually pure white linen from which a network of thin golden veins extend outward.
