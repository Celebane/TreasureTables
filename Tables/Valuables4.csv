A creature wielding the wand can focus on one mundane rodent (Weighing five pounds or less) that they can see within 50 feet and dominate its mind. The wielder can then dictate the rodent's every action and utterly control its movements for as long and the wielder maintains concentration. The rodent loses any trace or free will and the user is even able to force the rodent into suicidal situations such as jumping off buildings, charging into fire or attacking hungry cats. While controlling a rodent, the wielder can still speak and move but most other actions will take up too much of the user's attention and end the effect. The wand ceases to function if the wielder's concentration is broken, the rodent moves more than 50 feet away, the wielder is no longer able to see the rodent, the wand is released or the rodent dies."

The owner can command the pestle to work in a specific manner such as heavy pounding, a figure eight pattern, fine grinding in small circles, etc. The polished granite has not been magically hardened and may be damaged if ordered to grind anything more durable than itself or if it is left active while the mortar is empty."
74,"A small fan crafted to resemble a brightly colored humming bird. When the command word is spoken, the fan becomes animated and flaps its paper wings as it begins to hover around the user, creating a steady breeze of air around their face and head.

77,"Whispers of the Great Beyond: A lead figurine, depicting a striking young priestess, holding aloft a tentacled orb. From time to time, very faint muttering can be heard coming from the figurine. If placed next to a person's ear, the tentacled orb animates, caressing the holder's ear and enabling the muttering to be understood. When used, the figurine whispers disturbing truths that mankind was not meant to know and has a 25% chance (DM rolls in secret) that the user discerns “useful” information from the chaos. After listening to the object, the user becomes extremely suspicious of everything and everyone they meet, until they receive eight uninterrupted hours of restful sleep in a safe place. Bear in mind that the user's paranoid delusions can make it extremely hard to find a place they consider “safe” to sleep. The figurine can be used in this manner once per day. Frequent use of this item can cause lasting side effects which typically include but are not limited too; paranoid delusions, migraines, temporary loss of vision, dry mouth, audiovisual hallucinations, frequent urination, homicidal urges and the loss of an inner monologue (causing the creature to speak all their thoughts aloud). —Note: “Useful information” is subject to the DM's whims. For example, the user could learn how many ants are within a 100 foot radius, the direction of their closest enemy or the birth name of one of their allies. I suggest the DM use this to provide the PC's with plot hooks or nudges in the right direction if ever needed."
78,A blank stone coin which feels five times heavier while near large amounts of gold.
79,"Orphan's Top: A child's spinning top made of pristine white bone. A few well-placed holes have been drilled through the toy, causing it to sound like a crying child when in use.

80,"Spinning Totem: A child's spinning top made of steel with a distinctive weight and feel. A creature holding the toy begins to question their environment and experiences a faint but nagging idea that their world is not real. The totem becomes bonded to a bearer when it has been on their person for the last 30 days and has not been touched by any creature other than the bearer during that time. If the bearer is bonded to the totem, that creature can instantly cause it to appear in their hand. This effect functions even if the bearer is in an unconscious state, causing the totem to appear in their dreaming world. If spun, the top will continue to rotate indefinitely if the creature is currently in a dream state (Magical, mundane or lucid), coma, stasis, vivid hallucination or other unconscious or semi-conscious state. If the bearer is fully conscious and not subject to any such conditions the top stops spinning and falls normally."
81,"A small, plain wooden box containing the jaw bone and teeth of a saint. The remains rattle ominously when the bearer of the box seriously considers performing an evil act."
82,"Chew Bone: A forearm sized cow bone, covered in a delicious layer of fat, salt and gristle. The marrow, bone and salty fat layer perpetually regenerate, allowing it to be gnawed on indefinitely. Most carnivorous animals, especially canines find the bone particularly appetizing and will spend hours chomping on it. Although the object provides mild amounts of salt, fat and marrow, the bone is a light snack at most and would not substitute for a meal. When chewed, the bone fills the air with the smell of delicious fresh meat, which is strong enough to mask other odors. No doubt made for travelling adventures who wanted to reward and entertain their pets and animal companions on long journeys and clam their sensitive noses when in foul smelling areas."
83,"A small, unbreakable glass bottle with an undead faerie trapped inside of it. The rage filled creature, unendingly snarls and scratches at the glass as its bat-like wings flap ineffectively. If released for any reason, it will immediately fly away."

88,Fork of Poultry: A macabre eating utensil made from various cleaned sharpened chicken bones held together with sinew. Anything eaten with this fork tastes like chicken.
89,"Coin of the Watched: A perfectly ordinary looking gold coin with a barely noticeable etching of a goat's eye on it somewhere. After being in a creature's possession for over a day, the bearer will occasionally have the feeling that something or someone is watching him. The feeling grows in frequency and intensity as well as becoming more specific as to who or what is watching the bearer. After a few days in the bearer's possession he'll begin to feel that an animal of some kind is watching him the majority of the time. After a few weeks of having the coin in his possession, the bearer is absolutely certain that, no matter where he is or what he is doing, a goat is somehow watching him. The feeling of being watched drops off suddenly if the coin leaves the bearer's possession for more than 24 consecutive hours. The bearer is not aware that the feeling is caused by the coin nor does the coin emanate any kind of detectable magic. The coin usually passes out of the bearer's possession during a simple transaction after weeks to months depending on how often he uses his gold currency. However, the sudden cessation of the watched feeling can be more disturbing than the feeling itself. —Note: Goats are funny but feel free to substitute animals native to the local area or spiritually significant ones such as wolfs, elk, doves, tigers, lions bears or other totem and spirit animals. Alternatively animals with more sinister connotations like ravens, crows, rats, cockroaches, spiders, vultures, black cats or snakes can be used. Rather than animals, magical creatures, Gods or ideas such as demons, angels, witches, mages, a family member or ancestor, a generic “Something Evil” or they could even be tokens of a religion and that God is always watching over you."
90,"Choker of the Friendless: A close fitting choker type necklace of braided skunk tails. The object emits a foul odor in a ten-foot radius when worn that causes creatures with a sense of smell other than the bearer (Who is unable to notice the smell) to be physically nauseated. The odor is not perceivable past the ten-foot radius and the smell does not linger in a trail if the bearer happens to be moving. The stench is as powerful and distracting as a skunk's spray but not strong enough affect a creature's ability to act, speak, fight, cast spells etc."
91,A glass thermometer filled with seawater affixed to a wooden plaque inlaid with mother of pearl depicting an ocean scene. The thermometer is completely indifferent to the local temperature and is actually tracks the local tide. The seawater line in the glass coincides with relative height of the tide to the nearest shoreline. A knowledgeable creature can also determine if the tide is going in or out and use the thermometer as a clock to judge what time the tide will reach certain peaks and when it will turn.
92,"An iron flask holding a viscous liquid of intense emerald-green that smells faintly of citrus fruit. The liquid is a concentrated, magical dye for clothing and is equal to four full barrels of normal dye. If consumed, it enters the drinker's system and turns the creature green for a full month."

94,"A petrified gecko on a length of chain. While worn, the bearer is able to speak to and understand geckos as if they shared a common language. However, every gecko the bearer speaks to attempts to sell him insurance. No gecko will help, give advice or deal with the bearer in any way until the user buys some form of insurance which takes 15 minutes or more. If the bearer already has some type of insurance, the lizard is quick to point out that they could save a bunch of money by switching to gecko."

97,"An elegant pen made from a raven's feather with a gold tipped nib. If dictated to, the quill writes by itself in the flawless calligraphy of a master scribe. The pen writes in an inexhaustible supply of gold colored ink but can only be made to write upon parchment, canvas or vellum."
98,Bellowing Bullhorn: A hollowed out horn of a large bull with a brass handle fastened to it. The pointed tip of the horn has been removed and trimmed in brass to provide a mouthpiece. The horn doubles volume of any creature that speaks or yells into it.
99,"Dreamcatcher, Pure: A small wooden loop with intricate geometric designs woven from sinew within the circle. Dozens of white beads are nestled at what seem to be focal points in the designs. More sinew strings hang down from the loop entwined with a handful of bright colorful feathers of various birds. If the Dreamcatcher is placed in a near a creature's head, that creature will not suffer from bad dreams. When the creature would have a nightmare, the dream instead goes into one of the white beads turning it black. Each time this happens some of the bright coloring of the feathers will be leached away (Slowly turning them grey) and become good dreams for the creature."
100,"Dreamcatcher, Corrupted: A small wooden loop with intricate geometric designs woven from sinew within the circle. Dozens of black beads are nestled at what seem to be focal points in the designs. More sinew strings hang down from the loop entwined with a handful of limp feathers of various birds in drab shades of grey and black. If the Dreamcatcher is placed in a near a creature's head, that creature will not experience good dreams. When the creature would have a pleasant dream, the dream instead goes into one of the black beads turning it white. Each time this happens some of the grey coloring of the feathers will be leached away (Slowly turning them brightly colored) and become bad dreams for the creature."
