1,"A letter of personal letter of reference saying that the bearer and his companions should be allowed entry into the occult library of Arkham's Miskatonic University.

The letter was written and stamped by a Dr. Henry Armitage, who was the Chief Librarian at the time."
2,"A copper, hexagonal coin. On one side is a smiling face and the words “REMEMBER TO LIVE”. On the other is a skull and the words “REMEMBER YOU WILL DIE”."
3,"A star map depicting several celestial bodies that aren't visible to those without the Second Sight."
4,"An ornate incense holder that looks as though it should connect to a larger object. The sweet smell wafting from the perfumed censer hides a poisonous reaction within. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that the Brethers of the Seat of Infinity use these burnt offerings to confuse and confound their senses. In a state of rapturous delirium, they behold obscene truths and righteous falsehoods."
5,"A complete deck of antique playing cards that once belonged to a royal family. The face of one of the queens has been scribbled out."
6,"A piece of coloured glass, etched with a poem in Infernal that fills the bearer with melancholy when held."
7,"A fist sized piece of jagged garnet. The deep crimson and maroon gemstone pulses faintly and smells of blood."
8,"A simple silver flute perfect for a set of clever, delicate hands. Whenever the object is grasped, flashes of someone else's emotionally poignant memories flash in the bearer's mind as if long forgotten but suddenly remembered; You saved up all summer to buy it for your sister, thinking of how happy she'd be when you gave it to her on the day that you came home; but then the war came, and by the time it was over you had no home to go to. Now, every time you hear someone playing the flute, the same damn fool hope rises up in you that this time it's going to turn out to be her…"
9,"A nose made from colored glass that is sacred to a God of Craft."
10,"A portable ram composed of a sturdy wooden beam, banded with iron and ending in a heavy metal head. The head's broad and flat striking surface aligns with the beam's horizontal aspect.

11,"A sculpture of a single rose in full bloom, seemingly masterfully crafted and colored from an unidentifiable metal that leaves the sculpture pliant yet indestructible."

13,"A mummified humanoid hand coated with wax, with a wick projecting from the wax at the end of each finger. Knowledgeable PC's can identify it as a Hand of Glory, an occult artifact made from the left hand of a man hanged for the crime of murder."
14,"A preserved human heart in a decorative antique jar, glued shut to prevent the formaldehyde from leaking. It smells like roses in a hospital; medicinal and faintly sweet. The liquid glows dimly in the dark."

21,"A small, finely polished geode whose crystals slowly fade between every colour of the spectrum."

24,"A hammered pewter bowl and flatware."
25,"An old lucky coin that belonged to a sea captain from a foreign land, kidnapped by sea-sprites to marry their queen.

34,"A bronze-and-clockwork head of a woman, slightly larger than life-sized, clearly missing a chunk of mechanisms from the area of its throat. When wound up, the gears turn and the lips move as though trying to speak, but no sound comes out."

Whenever the object is grasped, flashes of someone else's emotionally poignant memories flash in the bearer's mind as if long forgotten but suddenly remembered; It was your mother's holy symbol. She had it blessed by the local priest, and gave it to you just before you set out on your first campaign. You wear it over your heart in every battle. May the gods watch over you, mother, wherever you are…"

51,"A dented pewter tankard engraved with a scene of wolves killing a stag."

54,"A fascinator made of gold filigree and bright blue feathers."
55,"An outwardly plain box carved with dwarven runes, surprisingly light, and roughly the size of a loaf of bread. Inside, the box is much more extravagant, lined with crushed velvet and studded with gems. An old dwarf nursery rhyme plays when the box is open “The Legend of Calibra Daliq,” a thieving dwarven wizard, who shrunk herself to sneak past guards and locked doors in order to get her riches. She was, of course, beheaded in the end for her crime."

57,"A decently sized skull that seems to be some sort of aberrant mix between rat and ^Humanoid^."
58,"A strange metallic artifact crafted in the rough shape of a squat wand, the tarnished object was forged from an alloy of gold and lead. The aberrant item is adorned with the strange heads of three fish-human hybrids, possibly Deep Ones, and is further decorated in a strange metallic amalgamation of unnatural and natural organic forms of marine fauna such as coral and mollusks.

65,"A crystal shard that hums and buzzes with a palpable energy, shimmering every possible color and others you only dream about. Staring at it gives you the feeling of swimming across time and space. Hot when near it, cool to the touch, its existence is a walking contradiction but you feel all the more confident for holding it."
66,"A small bizarre crystal that seems to glow faintly from within. It looks like amber, but is as hard as granite, but with an almost waxy finish. When you stare into it, you begin to see patterns, almost on the periphery, vague and indistinct. The more you look, the deeper you see."
67,"A jawbone made of siderite, a strange metal that comes from the stars. The jawbone itself is clearly impossible, as there are types of teeth from almost all known creatures and they seem to be…growing."
68,"A little rectangular mirror. When you touch a dent on the bottom of it, it will hold the image it reflected then for as long as you don't touch that dent again."
69,"A macabre wind chime whose bells are made of hollowed bones, the clappers and weights are rotting fingers and toes. It does have a pleasant sound at least, but to many that is even less reassuring."

83,"A forked stick that tends to points towards areas with very little water."
