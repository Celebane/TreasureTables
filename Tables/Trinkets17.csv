11,"The Heart of the Damned: An ancient dried human heart that still beats loud and strong and that takes its name from the legend of the man that it came from.

The lord of the keep knew that his walls would soon be overrun and, rather than surrendering and having his people enslaved, he slew them all. When the besiegers next attacked they found the lord standing amongst the slain, the sole survivor of the entire keep. The lord was burned at the stake and the legends say that his heart would not burn not matter how hot the flames became. According to superstition, the lord's tortured soul is bound to the heart and he will suffer the heat of the flames eternally until the curse is broken.
