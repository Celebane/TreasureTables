1,"Centaurs; The Life and Ways of Our Least Recognized Insects: A young scholar's dissertation explaining how centaurs are insects based mostly on the preposition that they each have three sets of limbs. The simply bound document takes itself seriously and is well written and meticulously sourced, even knowledgeable PC's would be hard pressed to find logical arguments against the paper's main thesis. There is no foreword and it is unknown if this work is meant to be some sort of scholarly joke or if it was some kind of malicious compliance from a frustrated student towards the professor who served as thesis adviser."
2,"The Sauce-erers Handbook: A waterproof oilskin case containing a small pocketbook with 101 delicious arcane condiments and advice on how to collect them and best incorporate them into meals."
3,"A small book bound in red leather that gives instructions on how to properly pet a house cat. It is surprisingly long and one pages appears to have been written in blood. The page in question says “How to pet a cat's belly... - DON'T!”."
4,"A suspiciously plain book with no outward markings and whose title “You Say You Want a Revolution?” is only apparently on the inside of the binding. The book contains a range of ideological ideas, songs and arguments loaded with logical fallacies, all meant to incite unrest and rebellion. Also contained are a surprising amount of catchy, lyrical songs that promote freedom, choice and liberation and decry the tyrannical oppression of authority."
5,"The Tao of Fu Leng: A book bound in the skin of humanoid creatures, emblazoned with the symbol of a spider, with smaller symbols creating a strange, interlocking pattern that seemed to trickle down the page. When a creature takes their eyes away from it, the symbols seemed to crawl in their peripheral vision. The book is a discourse on philosophy, a rationalization of the most terrible acts and thoughts a mortal mind could conceive. It speaks of actively furthering the goals of the Gods of Evil. Even standing in the book's presence for long periods of time can be dangerous for a creature's moral compass."
6,"The 13 Habits of Highly Effective Necromancers: A self help scroll penned by author Stephanus D. Coeuvry that presents a holistic, integrated, power-centered approach for solving problems with necromancy and the black arts. With dark humor and a blatant disregard for morality, Coeuvry reveals a step-by-step plan for raising your own undead army, plus tried and tested methods for handling standard problems like finding fresh corpses and dealing with pitchfork-wielding peasants."
7,"A journal written by a sea captain about the fictionalized romances of the ship's cat and what he imagined the cat got up to on shore leave."
8,"Encyclopedia of the Anvil: A heavy book with covers of stone, bound together with iron rings. Even to the untrained eye, this book seems to be of exceptional quality. Each page is richly illuminated, with orderly black-on-white lettering interspersed with intricate geometric designs and diagrams. The Encyclopedia is a legendary collection of works over the years by an unknown master dwarven wizard. With typical dwarven ingenuity and discipline, she applied herself to cataloging magic with the same intensity of focus that a master smith would bring to a life-long masterwork."
9,"A large tome titled ""My Way of Mischief"". Every entry seems to be written by a different person about a mischievous deed that they've done while they possessed the book. There is one blank page left."
10,"A pocket journal bound in sturdy leather bearing an extremely highly detailed drawing of Yggdrasil, the cosmic, plane-spanning, world tree on the first page. The tree's branches spread throughout the book, forming lines for writing. Though the book seems to consist of relatively few pages, when flipping through them one at a time, they seem to continue forever."
11,"A large, green leather-bound book with an embossed red triquetra on the cover. The book seems quite old but is only somewhat worn and is almost completely intact. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as a witch's book of shadows."
12,"A travel journal bound in tanned human skin and bleached bits of bone, locked with a black iron clasp in the shape of a demon's head. The clasp can only be unlocked by a creature who has sold their soul to a demon. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as a warlock's grimoire."
13,"A small brown leather bound book entitled ""The Coffee Table Book"". It details various males and styles of coffee tables including how to build some."
14,"A picture book filled with watercolour paintings of various species of turtles. The beautiful calligraphy scrawled at the bottom of each page tells incorrect facts about each one."
15,"Tome of the Searing Flame: A book whose covers are made from iron that constantly feel hot to the touch and inlaid with rubies and shards of igneous rock that seem to glow with the power of elemental fire. The pages appear to be made from lava that is perfectly safe to touch. The book can weather even the most powerful of flames entirely unscathed, as it has been recorded to have spent at least a decade immersed in the magma of an active volcano, before being forced out in a river of lava when it erupted. The book contains intricate descriptions of many powerful beings of elemental fire, along with descriptions of countless creatures of elemental fire, from fire elementals to magmins. The book is held shut by a clasp shaped to look like a flickering flame. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that this is one of the five legendary works written by an ancient elven wizard known as Xaturos the Illuminator. For five hundred years, Xaturos scoured the four Elemental Planes and the Astral Plane seeking lost knowledge before supposedly settling in the Astral Plane, though countless conflicting tales of the wizard's whereabouts abound, mixed in with tales of his death."
16,"A small handbook book filled with tips on how to charm your mother in law."
17,"A small book containing a poorly written ghost story about a haunted thimble that pinches thumbs."
18,"A small scrap book from an autumnal season well over a century ago. Each page holds several beautiful leaves preserved at their peak colour. They are lovely colours and shades ranging from bright yellow to a rusty red."
19,"A rattan journal that contains only mad ravings and disturbing scribbles of nightmarish horrors. The author's identity is not revealed nor hinted at, however knowledgeable PC's will recognize enough arcane runes and sigils to deduce that the writer was a powerful if mad spellcaster."
20,"A large book with a hand-painted cover depicting a king eating a child's leg. The story in the book tells a morbid tale of an ancient king that would eat disobedient children."

27,"A Hag Ate My Baby!: A generically evil looking book for older children, containing an assortment of cliche horror stories."
28,"Tome of the Roaring Ocean: A book whose covers are made from coral that constantly feels cool to the touch and inlaid with sapphires and assorted marine animal parts, such as scales and teeth that seem to glow with the power of elemental water. The pages are made from surprisingly robust kelp. The book can weather even the most powerful of chills entirely unscathed, as it has been recorded to have spent at least a decade trapped within a freezing river in the middle of a glacier. The book contains intricate descriptions of many powerful beings of elemental water, along with descriptions of countless creatures of elemental water, from water elementals to ice mephits. The book is held shut by a clasp shaped to look like droplets of water. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that this is one of the five legendary works written by an ancient elven wizard known as Xaturos the Illuminator.

30,"Help, My Child Is An Adventurer!: A thin paperback that serves as a quick guide on self-defense for the concerned parents of heroes and adventures who are prone to making grudge carrying enemies by the score. It mostly focuses on buying a crossbow, changing your name and moving on a regular basis."
31,"Encyclopedia of Arcane Terminology (Volumes 1, 2 and 3): A trio of volumes that explains magical ideas and terminology in layman's terms. The descriptions on the book's back covers describes them best: ""Want to astonish your friends with your knowledge? Want to woo the well-travelled mage that just popped into town with that group of adventurers? Want to finally be able to say Thaumaturgy without tying your tongue? This is your book!"
32,"A reference book entitled “Cantrips and You: A Beginners Guide”. The dogeared pages are heavily worn and there are handwritten notes in the margins of the pages."
33,"A lightweight handbook entitled “Rogues Guide to Rooftop Running.” The edition is water damaged and a significant amount of ink has run through the pages making it difficult to read."
34,"A strangely constructed periodical entitled “Druids Staff Quarterly”. The book's covers are made from tree bark and the rough leather pages are bound to it with dried vines."
35,"A bound collection of pamphlets written by a mermaid with a political agenda entitled “Fish are Friends, NOT Food”."
36,"A book entitled “Poetry in Motion” that explains in lovingly rich detail the history of a specific martial art and its growth from origin to its modern use. The book has detailed calligraphy of many of the fighting forms as well as examples of how they are used."
37,"A book entitled “These Furry Fellas” filled with advice for hunting and tracking woodland animals. The book is crudely bound in animal hide, some of which still has fur remaining."
38,"A suspiciously plain book with no outward markings and whose title “Time Tested Tricks of Tongue Fighting” is only apparently on the inside of the binding. The book is a collection of advice, tips and tricks for how to win verbal arguments, discussions and shouting matches with the opposite sex (It has an equal amount of advice for both men and women) along with a surprising amount of suggestions on how to become a better kisser."
39,"A self help book entitled “When Life Gives You Lemons”. The book is mostly unreadable as its center has been deliberately hollowed out to make room for a small box containing a ^AllRings^"
40,"A leather bound book whose title “Nock, Draw, Loose!” is prominently branded on its front. Casual perusal reveals it to be a field archer's manual outlying precise instructions on how to create, maintain and modify bows, bowstrings and arrows with minimal resources while in the field."
41,"A small handbook entitled “CAMPFIRE COOKING: 101 Recipes for the Hungry Adventurer”. It's covering is missing and the pages are bound with string woven through holes near the spine."
42,"A collection of erotic short stories all centered around an intelligent and sexually liberated woman, insultingly titled “The Village Bike”. A simple inspection of the back cover reveals it was written by a lonely bachelor and self described “Nice guy”."
43,"A foul book known as the “Liber Bubonicus” which is inscribed with the clandestine lores of corrupt magic, and contains an overview of every disease, pest and plague in the world. The inside of the book is stamped with the holy symbol of the God of Pestilence, Plagues and Disease. Perhaps not surprisingly, there is not a single line of text that speaks of how to treat diseases, exterminate pests or cure plagues."
44,"A mage's grimoire which contains an obscure philosophical treatise on ritual magic which verges on the senseless due to bad translation."
45,"A small travel handbook filled with dozens of dichotomous keys of lizards, reptiles and amphibians in rarely traveled parts of the world."
46,"Corin Tasslefoot's Recipe Book: A simply bound book decorated with a border of green vines. This homely book is a set of family recipes from a humble halfling farmer. He wrote down recipes from his extended family, including his great-grandmother. The meals are generally wholesome rustic food but despite that are delicious, filling, and sustaining. There are a number of recipes for travel food, from way bread and travel rations to making a good meal from the land."
47,"A pocket sized book that graphically details the random adventures of a royal huntsman."
48,"The Pillow Book of Date Momoko: A beautifully illustrated scroll that you wouldn't take home to your mother. It is beautifully created, written on exquisitely prepared paper and the illustrations are exquisite. But let's just say that people have been known to spontaneously combust while reading it. The High Priest of Eros said it was ""A bit much..."". The High Priestess ran off with her copy and hasn't been seen since. However, if there are questions about bedroom ... matters that you wish addressed, well, somewhere in this scroll I'm sure it will be. In detail. With diagrams. And, some say, maths. There is a story running throughout, of a young bride-to-be asking her female relatives for advice on her upcoming wedding night."
49,"A richly illuminated, leather-bound manuscript of local history."
50,"The Ballad of Barrik and Theda: A new book recounting old dwarvish tales from the dwarvish historian Torgrim Stonehalter recounts in vivid detail the doomed adventures of Barrik and Theda the legendary dwarvish heroes and lovers of a past age. Stonehalter presents new evidence (Found in the ruins of the library at Tornikkberg) that Theda was indeed the real leader of the duo, taking initiative in slaying the dragon Baazthys, and that Barrik's devotion to Theda may not have been as unwavering as the tales and songs would have you believe."
51,"More Tales from Beyond the Veil: A sequel to a popular religious book. Brother Calymus takes his readers further into the Spirit Realm with a new collection of stories and essays to follow up his first. Each of these focuses on a first-hand account of the journey from life to death told to Calymus by a ghost, a resurrected individual or a soul called forth from the other realms. Critics suggest Calymus sensationalizes the tales a bit to make death sound more frightening than it is, to which he challenges them to explore death on their own and then come back to talk about it."
52,"Scroll of Rhythm: A mostly useless magical scroll in a decorative case. When someone versed in arcane magic reads this scroll, they can't help but start speaking in rhythm, snapping their fingers, and tapping their toes. The words start rhyme as the reader marks the time, and all those who are near can't resist the beat they hear. They start to bounce and dance as if they're in a trance. It only lasts a minute til the reader reaches the end. Then the scroll disappears back into its case, and all is as before."
53,"Proper Methods of Dress, and Other Pressing Issues, Fourth Edition: A quaint etiquette guide of Domoic origin goes into great detail on exactly how a gentleman or noblewoman of proper breeding should look, act, and think. Notably, more than fifty pages are dedicated to how many waistcoat buttons should be buttoned according to time of day. This edition begins with a blaring notice that, following the Petticoat Massacre, it is now considered an unforgivable faux pas to allow one's coattails to flap in the wind. A new sartorial device called a ""Tail Stiffener"" is essential for anyone wishing to make a good impression."
54,"A torn and tattered book that gives step-by-step instructions on how to establish dominance in jail amongst other prisoners."
55,"Tome of the Tearing Gale: A book whose covers are made from extremely thin sheets of electrum that are far stronger than they appear and inlaid with emeralds and feathers that seem to glow with the power of elemental air. The pages appear to be made from clouds, though they don't disperse, remaining within the boundaries of the book at all times. The book can weather even the most powerful of storms entirely unscathed, as it has been recorded to have spent at least a decade trapped within a gigantic tornado, before being ripped out by a wild roc. The book contains intricate descriptions of many powerful beings of elemental air, along with descriptions of countless creatures of elemental air, from air elementals to invisible stalkers. The book is held shut by a clasp shaped like a cloud. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that this is one of the five legendary works written by an ancient elven wizard known as Xaturos the Illuminator. For five hundred years, Xaturos scoured the four Elemental Planes and the Astral Plane seeking lost knowledge before supposedly settling in the Astral Plane, though countless conflicting tales of the wizard's whereabouts abound, mixed in with tales of his death."
56,"Fanwen's Funney Joaks: A satirical publication by a local troublemaker Fanwen Grist who has discovered a lucrative career peddling his crude humor to the lower classes, selling new collections of jokes, lewd stories, and new slang whenever his coffers run a bit low. While writing this issue, Fanwen seems to have become particularly amused by the upper crust's recent obsession with an accessory called a ""Tail Stiffener."""
57,"A decently sized tome with a hastily drawn picture of a hawk on the leather bound cover. The book is filled with nonsensical paragraphs on the nature of hawks and its obvious that whoever created this had an unhealthy obsession with avian raptors."
58,"A diary once belonging to the reclusive lich Xerichides. This one volume of many is a personal account of the undead mage's lengthy battle with an unknown hero. After reading the entire diary, an intelligent PC may be able to piece together the location where the hero is still trapped in an imprisonment spell and the conditions to free them."
59,"Trimple, Primple, Prample and Zot: A collection of works by Gilathil Greenleaf that originally became madly popular exclusively among people who could not speak elvish, captivated by the poet's soothing rhymes, wondering what deep mysteries such beautiful language must contain. Those who know Elvish, of course, know that the poems are nothing more than meaningless gibberish, words made up exclusively for their aesthetic sound. The popularity of this book in human lands is yet another reason elves tend to look down upon ""lesser peoples."""
60,"A tiny, hand drawn flip book showing a knight running from a Beholder."
61,"Kalathraxas and the Basilisk's Eye: A small pulp children's adventure novel that is the fourth installment in the series. According to the synopsis printed on the back of the book: “Kalathraxas, The Good Necromancer, has succeeded in defeating the evil Pelfanus, but now he faces his greatest enemy: himself. Can Kal overcome the geas cast upon him by a rival wizard and prevent the Basilisk's Eye from falling into the wrong hands?”."
62,"The Fall of the Haloan Empire: A historical text that, on the surface appears to merely be a recounting of the opulent Haloan Empire's fall from power centuries ago. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that some scholars claim, that careful analysis reveals it as a scathing commentary on the notoriously corrupt court of King Judicus, written in code to keep the author from harm."
63,"Lelesh Voth: A thick, bound book that is locked by magic and only unlocks itself when touched by a creature capable of casting magical spells. The tome's arcane title translates to common as ""The Power of Pacifism."" Should one find a way to open the book's magical lock, they will find that the book's pages have been carved out to make room for a magically sharp dagger with a golden hilt."
64,"The Wise Wizard's Guide to Fireball Safety: A mage's instructional text that is another in Germund the Scholar's Wise Wizard's Guide to series of spell manuals. This copy looks like the binding has never even been cracked, but the edges of the pages are singed, and the back cover has been entirely burned off."
65,"Incomes & Expenditures, Council Treasury, vol. 343: A relatively recent financial ledger, with hundreds of pages of densely-packed tables of numbers and brief descriptions. It would take weeks to comb through this information, even for someone with extensive knowledge of the Council's financial practices, but surely there's no need to scrutinize things so closely."
66,"101 Magical Tips for the Busy Housewife: A thick, cheaply printed pamphlet, the contents of which largely consists of its overly long introduction, which tells the reader how to harness ""mental magic"" and wield ""the ancient arts"" to maintain a tidier home. Despite these promises, the pamphlet teaches absolutely nothing that's magical in nature; rather, the final six pages are merely a hastily written list of general (And mundane) housekeeping tips, such as ""Sweep your entranceway daily, to keep dirt from getting tracked about the house."" Several of the tips are duplicates, as well; the total number of unique tips is actually closer to eighty."
67,"On the Anatomy of Goblinoid Bodies: A medical text bound in leather with the title branded into the spine. It is an exhaustive exploration of the bodies of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, this is the life's work of Barber Stanwen Nolik. It appears highly reputable, but no other surgeon has ever been willing to replicate Nolik's work."
68,"The Herbalist's Guide to Tea: A small illustrated guide complied by Anthony Crispaen, the Earl of Grey, who was an enthusiastic herbalist and alchemist. He collected all his findings and those of the druidic circles of Grey in his writings, illustrated by an artist passing through town by chance. Unfortunately the artist accidentally confused Lady's Smock with Nightshade, and the Earl died shortly after tea time the day he published the book."
69,"Barbarian's Cookbook: A hidebound book for illiterate cooks that has lots of pictures and simple recipes, mostly meat."
70,"Scroll of Common Nonsense: A tightly rolled scroll full of useless information. Anyone reading this scroll can almost understand it, but nobody really agrees on what it says."
71,"The Wisdom of King Judicus: A book containing more than a dozen fables and tales meant to impart life lessons for all members of the kingdom, each one is short and easily memorized. Some of the most famous examples include The Audacious Honeybee, which describes the dangers of trying to rise above your station in life, and the grisly cautionary tale of The Dog Who Betrayed His Master for a Bone."
72,"The Codex of Unspeakable Damnation: An old and highly-sought treatise on mastering chaos. Within its blasphemous pages are instructions on drawing power from human sacrifice, a variety of dangerous rituals, advice for using black magic, details on the minions of Chaos, and a guide to founding cults. It's not known who penned this book, but its pages are all carefully illuminated with perverse images framing each page."
73,"An instructional book on how to laugh convincingly and emote properly when uncomfortable."
74,"Tome of the Unending Expanse: A book whose covers are made from purple fabric that feels as sturdy as a thick sheet of iron and inlaid with diamonds and pieces of wool that seem to glow with the power of the Astral Plane. The pages are made from tangible sheets of purple energy that are indescribable to touch. The book can weather even the most powerful of arcane energies entirely unscathed, as it has been recorded to have spent at least a decade trapped within a maelstrom of magical power on the Astral Plane, before being flung out by an errant blast of energy. The book contains intricate descriptions of many powerful beings that inhabit the Astral Plane, along with descriptions of countless creatures that dwell within the Astral Plane. The book is held shut by a clasp shaped like a rectangle. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that this is one of the five legendary works written by an ancient elven wizard known as Xaturos the Illuminator. For five hundred years, Xaturos scoured the four Elemental Planes and the Astral Plane seeking lost knowledge before supposedly settling in the Astral Plane, though countless conflicting tales of the wizard's whereabouts abound, mixed in with tales of his death."
75,"Celestine Book of Divination: A cursory glance through this tome reveals little, and is harmless. However, any serious effort to examine the work, to piece together the curious blend of prophecy and gibberish, to sift through the meaningless nonsense to arrive at the kernels of truth, can drive a reader insane. As disturbing as the book is, most scholars see the volume as nothing more than the ravings of a madman and so discount it."
76,"The Catalogue of Flesh: An incredible index of all things demonic. Each page is devoted to some new horror conjured forth from the dark imaginings of the ruinous powers of evil. Unsurprisingly the volume's pages are vellum made from delicate skin with covers of thick leather bound together braided sinew, all of human origin."
77,"Book of Secrets: A massive tome consisting of red leather and steel fittings which protect the pale vellum pages inside. The exterior is covered in strange glyphs and runes of the arcane language of magic. Those who can read magic get a sense of what this volume contains, the exploitation of magical energy in its many forms for the reader's personal gain."
78,"Kenku's Book of Insults: An old book hailing from a... less peaceable era. Earmarked by use and yellowed from time, this book was compiled by long ago by a rude Kenku who needed a reservoir of mean names to call people. Filled with slander and derision, the book over time absorbed the wickedness of those who provided it material as well as the anger of those who it was used against. Some claim they can hear the faint sound of cackling as they turn its pages. Any creature who opens the book in anger with a specific creature in mind will find a particularly vicious insult that is perfectly suited for that foe. The presented insults are always mean-spirited and never bear a playful or joking tone."
79,"A pink notebook filled with diary entries from a young elvish girl."
80,"The Great Book of Grudges: An ancient book passed down through the ages from one dwarven high king to the next. It was last held by the reigning high king, Thorgrim Grudgebearer. The Great Book of Grudges is essentially a record of all the terrible wrongs and treacherous deeds ever perpetrated against the dwarf race. The book is written in the blood of dwarfs and only they have the authority to add new grudges or strike out grudges that have been avenged. Essentially, the Book of Grudges amounts to a very detailed but oddly vengeful recorded history of the dwarf race."
81,"An ogre cookbook on the delicate art of cooking humans entitled “To Serve Man”."
82,"The Tome of Current Thought: As a creature reads this book, the pages fill with a running record of whatever the reader happens to be thinking at the moment. For those who are unaware of what they're reading, this can be a terrifying experience as they see their own private thoughts wrought on the page. For instance, should the reader happen to recall an embarrassing memory, it would instantly appear. Oh dear, any horrible memory? Including the time mother caught me alone in the stables? Wait, how does this book know about the time mother caught me alone in the stables? Is this some sort of joke? Who wrote this? How do I stop this?"
83,"A mage's guidebook on how to take care of you're newly acquired magical companion entitled “It's Familiar, But Not Too Familiar”."
84,"Pop-up Book of Wild Animals: A thick, children's book that has a simply painted picture of various monsters on its front cover. Each interior page is cleverly rigged so that parts of the pages fold outward in creating a pop-up effect. The book contains just over a dozen pop-up depictions of various natural creatures of the world and a simple poem about each creature it bright cheery colors."
85,"A blank, lightweight journal with an oilskin cover. It contains 50 blank pages."
86,"Necromantic Ethics: A small manual by Gleebones Lemontwig, on how to be a necromancer without doing horrible things to people. This black tome contains the true secrets of necromancy, namely how to use those without committing acts of great evil against others or endanger the caster's soul. Be it by pragmatism or legal waivers, the reader can learn how to raise the dead without damning themselves to the nine hells to be forever tortured by the souls of those they raised. The book noticeably lacks the ceremonies considered evil by most, such as how to become a Lich or raising an entire army of the undead."
87,"A small, worn, leather pocket book filled with beautiful sketches and watercolour images of unfamiliar landscapes, none of which are signed."
88,"Forging The End; Baron Stoneye's Guide To Creating Your Very Own Apocalypse: A thick tome containing every plan possible on how to end the world. The potentially world ending guide magically updates when a new plan is formed. Penned on the side cover of the book seems to be an advertisement for the shop that the book was sold at and no doubt the source of the magical update. The message reads “Do you seek the end of the world but lack the creativity to do it on your own? Well then my friend seek out this tome, located in Bloodcrown's Books in the underbelly of the Underdark. Do you seek to raise the dread tarrasque from its slumber? Maybe you wish to know the rituals to summon hordes of outsiders ready to rend and tear this world apart. Seek out Bloodcrown's Books, find the tome and set free a plague of apocalypse level events the likes of which this world has never seen.”."
89,"A stiff, seemingly normal hardcover pocket book, that when opened reveals a small compartment that holds a map written in orcish. It has so many spelling and grammatical errors not even those who can read orcish can understand what the map says."
90,"Syn Qutain's Histories of the Middel-South; Edition the Fifth: An original manuscript of the much-reproduced history text, its well-reputed author's final work. The chronicle itself passingly mentions a rumored treasure, artifact, or relic (Commonly believed to be myth.) as though its existence is fact. Perceptive PC's will notice that the pages are lightly watermarked. When held up to light, terrains and landmarks appear, which anyone familiar with the region may recognize. As the pages are turned, the terrain appears to shift also, finally zooming in and settling on one particular spot, where on the final page the author seems to have accidentally dropped a bit of sealing wax."
91,"A journal decorated with strips of emeralds laid in the pattern of a cat's eye and gilded in gold leaf. It contains a record of a cat burglar's inventory of stolen goods and where they were “obtained”."
92,"The Book of Night: A shadow mage's grimoire that is difficult to describe, in no small part because looking directly at the artifact is nearly impossible. Casual glances slide straight over the book; it is somewhat possible to get an understanding of what it looks like merely through peripheral vision, but only a concerted effort of extreme willpower can overcome this particular attribute. Once the viewer's will has been asserted, however, the book's appearance truly manifests itself. The cover is unmarked and black, neither matte nor glossy; simply black. The surface is, furthermore, adorned with silver points of varying size. Should one attempt to move the Book, they will notice that these silver markings move; or, rather, remain fixed relative to the position of the Book. When they reach the edge of the cover, they vanish, and are replaced by others that appear on the opposite edge. A particularly astute observer will note that, when held aloft and compared to the night sky, the markings match the positions of visible stars."
93,"A book bound in scuffed leather with step-by-step instructions and illustrations on how to field dress and butcher common woodland animals."
94,"Tome of the Unrelenting Earth: A book whose covers are made from stone that looks rough yet feels smooth to the touch and inlaid with garnets and small pieces of metal that seem to glow with the power of elemental earth. The pages are made from stone that looks rigid, yet bends as easily as parchment. The book can weather even the most powerful of strikes entirely unscathed, as it has been recorded to have spent at least a decade trapped within the fissure left by an earthquake, before being ripped out by a wandering bulette. The book contains intricate descriptions of many powerful beings of elemental earth, along with descriptions of countless creatures of elemental earth, from earth elementals to xorn. The book is held shut by a clasp shaped like a mountain. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that this is one of the five legendary works written by an ancient elven wizard known as Xaturos the Illuminator. For five hundred years, Xaturos scoured the four Elemental Planes and the Astral Plane seeking lost knowledge before supposedly settling in the Astral Plane, though countless conflicting tales of the wizard's whereabouts abound, mixed in with tales of his death."
95,"An unedited scholar's dissertation on how to tell the difference between a Gnome and a Halfling."
96,"Aerlin's Heirloom: A great, ornate tome in a locked case. The protective case is an elaborate box guarded by a very complicated lock. Through a window of unbreakable glass a huge tome can be seen, bound in leather and trimmed in gold and jewels with an elaborate crest on the cover. The first page of the book is an exquisite etched plate print of a very elderly looking elf nobleman with the name Tabarus Now'nathal scribed under it, and inside the cover is a simple inscription: From All of Us. The next plate is an etching of an elderly elf woman. Neanna Now'nathal, wife. Then three more plates of his two sons and his daughter. Then his seven grandchildren, and his 27 great grandchildren. The faces get younger as the book goes on and it goes for 689 pages until it ends on a picture of a baby elf girl titled Nelonna Artenala, sixth great granddaughter."
97,"A blood stained copy of a medical book written by a discredited doctor, outlining a confusing and probably not very effective way to do heart surgery."
98,"On the Hunting of Fauna and Fowl in the Baldred Mountains; Ed. II: A guide to the natural inhabitants of the Baldred Mountains, this plain texted book is sturdily made with an embossed leather cover. It details the hunting, preparing and cooking of most animals to be found in the aforementioned mountains.

Account however vary on the very last details of his life and how he in fact met his end. The book itself rarely agrees, telling a new story to every reader with the seeming intent to cause the greatest feelings sadness and pity that they may extract from the reader. Only the most cold-hearted readers of the tome have read it without it eliciting a tear, while others are haunted by the sadness for the rest of their days by the tale.

It is also impossible to tell with any reasonable degree of certainty how Garum met his end. It is known, however, that this was the last and most notable of his bequeathed creations."
