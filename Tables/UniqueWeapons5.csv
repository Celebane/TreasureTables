1,"A greatsword whose blade is as black as the night sky and sparkles with the stars of alien constellations. The chill of the endless void emanates from the weapon, and those who stare into its blade too long get the eerie feeling that the stars within are slowly drifting closer…"
2,"The ^RandomSwordTable^ is mundane looking with the exception of the cutting edge of its blade which is made from sparkling ruby. The razor sharp gem has been magically reinforced so it does not chip, dull, or crack. When the weapon is used to cut flesh, the wound always results in a vivid, blood red scar, regardless of how it heals."
3,"A oak handled flail attached to an iron chain ending in a specialized head, forged in the shape of the holy symbol of the God of ^RandomGodlyDomains^."
4,"A dark green leather quiver containing 20 arrows each with hollowed, bone heads. When fired, air passes through the head, creating a screeching noise that can be used to signal allies, distract enemies or scare wild game."
5,"A rare and ancient war-sword with an iron blade decorated with ill-boding patterns that have been tempered in blood. A creature wielding the shining longsword feels as though it will never fail anyone who hefts it in battle, nor anyone who has fought and faced the worst in the gap of danger. The wielder feels certain that the sword has been used to perform heroic deeds in the past."
6,"A cudgel (Club statistics) carved from the branch of a tree from which a soothsayer was lynched for delivering one too many unfavourable divinations of the future. Creatures who are knocked unconscious by this weapon experience vivid prophetic dreams of tragic events that may yet come to pass."
7,"A knight's lance that shines with unearthly light and is crafted to look like a snarling dragon. Blood bubbles and boils from the weapon, leaving it pristine after every strike."
8,"A series of dark runes are carved along the ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^'s length. A creature who attempts to read the runes is unable to decipher them. That night, the creature has horrific dreams and awakes with bloody tears in their eyes. For the rest of the day, every time the creature blinks or closes their eyes, they see the runes, burnt into their retinas."
9,"A pike crafted from a single giant rose thorn, engraved with vines that spiral from the tip."
10,"A plain, unadorned longbow made of solid black wood. Black leather wrapped around the staff provides a firm grip, and even the bowstring has been dyed black. Though its appearance is unremarkable, the bow intermittently whispers softly in Elven, audible only to its wielder, speaking of loss and grief. If a living drow is within the bow's range, the whispers become more frequent and angry, speaking of terrible vengeance on all dark elves."
11,"A graceful mage's quarterstaff topped by a swirling cloudy stone encircled with black iron filigree."
12,"A beautifully crafted ^RandomSwordTable^ with a screaming face upon the hilt. As it moves through the air, the blade shrieks and wails hungrily for the blood of men. The terrible howling of the blade can cause even the most staunch of heroes to cower in fear."
13,"A silvered dagger that has the name “Mercyblade” engraved into the blade in celestial. The hilt is shaped to look like a pair of angel wings and the weapon feels uncomfortably hot when held by evil creatures."
14,"A longsword with with a platinum hilt and a thin crystal blade. The hilt is expertly engraved and the center of the crossguard is set with a sapphire gem. The blade is long and slender and as strong as steel."
15,"A pike consisting of a single long gray bone that emits a chilling aura. Along its length run veins of dark, softly glowing energy."
16,"A halberd with a shaft of smooth bright white wood, the grain of which spirals upward rather than being straight along its length. The weapon's head is tri-bladed long and thin, made of roughly cut, magically strengthened onyx. Though the blades are rough the edges themselves are extraordinarily sharp."
17,"The ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ is engraved with a prayer in a long dead language next to the holy symbol of an ancient and all but forgotten God."
18,"A bronze warhammer whose twin blunt ends are fashioned in the shape of two hellhound heads with glowing red eyes."
19,"A shortsword with a polished, almost-white blade that's always cool to the touch. The pommel is twined silver and adamantine and set with a sparkling diamond."
20,"An imposing stone maul with the inscription “YOUR HEAD HERE” carved into its face."
21,"A reddish stain covers the ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^, the dried blood of a long forgotten battle. It never washes out, despite the best efforts of soap, acid or magic."
22,"The otherwise ordinary ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ has a glass eye adorning it somewhere. When unobserved, the eye occasionally moves around to a new location on the weapon and shifts in appearance. It might change shape to that of a cat, cuttlefish, goat or gecko and becomes a new random color. Otherwise the eye changes to look the exact same as the last creature the weapon was used to kill."
23,"A wooden quarterstaff topped by a disembodied golden dragon claw that clutches a pale blue crystal orb."
24,"A whip made from the shrunken tentacle of a great sea creature that still twitches slightly on its own."
25,"An ornately carved cedar hand crossbow, ordained with depictions of benevolent gods giving to their creations."
26,"A five foot tapered pole, bound in steel with a narrow metal spike projecting from the top. This infantry weapon is commonly known as a planson and is designed for smashing and thrusting. The planson can be used as a club (And weighs as much as a mace) or as a sturdy, if top-heavy, shortspear."
27,"A large heavy ^RandomSwordTable^ made of iron with a bronze hilt. The blade passes through the mouth of a skull, human apart from the fact it has three eye sockets. The back of the skull was omitted, allowing the face to form a basket hilt. The blade is etched with three runes of power, denoting allegiance to demons. Creatures who see the weapon get the sense of an immense, brooding, dark power behind it, a power with rage boiling just beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to erupt. Once a creature has seen the weapon, they are constantly aware of it as long as it is in their possession, like a dark weight lurking at the back of their minds,"
28,"A fetid leather quiver containing a dozen throwing hammers made of black iron that seems to absorb ambient light around them."
29,"A two handed trident ornately decorated with aquatic images and bearing the holy symbol of the God of the Oceans on it's grip. When grasped, the weapon emanates a divine fervor, urging its wielder to follow its lead and fight for its causes. During times of restlessness, the trident's prongs begin to hum nautical tunes that vary from sea shanties to sacred hymns of the Sea God."
30,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a blade made out of pale gold, with engravings of a snake devouring its prey decorating the hilt, guard and scabbard. The blade curses its bearer with dark thoughts of how he will fail in the future. These feelings are rare at first and grow increasingly more frequent as time goes on. The weapon's bearer may not necessarily be aware that the weapon is the source of these concerns of future failures and self doubt."
31,"A plain and unadorned warhammer with a steel head and a haft made from the golden wood of a gingko tree. When it's wielded, the weapon glows with a soft, silver-black light. A long time bearer will suffer from mild agoraphobia and will be uneasy whenever they are not inside, underground or at night. This effect goes away quickly on its own as long as the warhammer is not consistently carried."
32,"A rapier scarred with a flowing mass of darkness that almost entirely obscures the shine of it's blade."
33,"The ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ has strange glowing symbols that run along its entire length, that only the wielder can see. When grasped outside of combat, the surrounding area stills, allowing the bearer to hear unrecognizable, but hate filled whispers. The air of the area feels dense and heavy as if the wielder is trapped and unable to breath anything but stale air. These phenomenon are only experienced by the wielder, vanish immediately when the weapon is released and never cause any physically harmful effects."
34,"An elegantly carved light crossbow that bears the motifs of wild, game animals carved along its length."
35,"A yew longbow strung with a thick silk line that seems to hum even when still."
36,"A beautiful fullblade with a pure white guard and a shining blade with glyphs lining its edge."
37,"A greatsword bearing an onyx blade with jagged edges resembling hooked fangs that were made to injure and maim in addition to killing. The face of the blade is inscribed with an array of runes that when transcribed, translates to:“Seek me, if thy hatred is brighter than the sun, if thy need for vengeance is stronger than the will to live. I am the key and you, the lock.” The warped and twisted hilt of the dark sword is made of a charred-looking material, shaped into a set of horns that hook up and outwards. The handle is made of a rich gray wood wrapped in leather and the pommel looks to be a face twisted into a snarl."
38,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a gleaming blade as white as snow and a fine blue silk handle and a black guard made of iron. The weapon grossly inflated the ego of anyone who carries it and exaggerates their sin of hubris."
39,"A long, gray glaive with a wide dark gray-blue blade. The metallic joint between staff and blade has an illusionary beast of lightning curled around it with soft blue mist drifting of its eye."
40,"A perfectly balanced scimitar made of folded, acid washed metal. The curved, cruel looking weapon's steel blade displays a pattern similar to raindrops sliding down glass."
41,"A morningstar shaped like an accumulation of tentacles that seems to move on its own when not directly looked at. The pattern of spikes on the weapon's head appears to change their position slowly every few hours. The grip is made out of an unknown leathery material and the pommel is set with a gemstone that resembles nothing more than a large, green, unblinking eye."
42,"A pair of daggers that appear to be made of an amalgamation of various metals welded together with no particular style. It looks as though they were crafted from numerous other bladed weapons that were broken up and forged back together. The daggers bear matching inscriptions along their blades which says “The Strength Of The Wolf Is The Pack” on one and “The Strength Of The Pack Is The Wolf” on the other."
43,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a marbled black blade with a red hilt and a matching scabbard. The weapon seems to make the people nearby more irritable than normal, which usually results an increasing number of violent incidents in the area the blade has traveled. When wielding during combat the sword gleams a dull red."
44,"A slightly transparent light pick that has a black and blue sheen to it when exposed to light."
45,"A katana with a long flawless blade bearing a cutting edge so fine it could split a hair into several strands. The sheathe is black with three, evenly spaced red bands near the scabbard's mouth. The length of the scabbard is decorated in calming, ornate, cloud patterns in pink. Just above the topmost band rests a half-bloomed pink flower that has been tied in place, reasons unknown. Despite one's best efforts, the flower is incapable of being removed."
46,"A spiked chain with black onyx grips wrapped in dark leather. The chain links seem to be made of pure shadow that curve into the wickedly sharp spiked points. The entire weapon appears to be surrounded by an aura of radiance that is being continually sucked in and nullified by the chain."
47,"A silver dagger whose blade is etched with stylized spiderwebs and ends with a hilt shaped like a skeleton in repose."
48,"A war scythe whose handle is made of a oddly giving, semi transparent substance with streams of what appears to be fire and ice moving throughout. The top blade of the scythe extends outward from the handle and is made of what seems to be pure starlight. When swung, the weapon leaves trails of light and darkness that quickly dissipates."
49,"A powerful and twisted ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^, that glows with a reddish, shadow-like aura from the blood of all noble heroes who were killed by it."
50,"A small shortsword that is similar in design to a saber, with a thin blade and silver engravings depicting a rose blossoming in a field of fallen warriors. Its handle is a strange felt-like, black material that is pleasant to hold and has a rather small, rose-bud shaped guard that the blade extends from."
51,"A warhammer with a head formed in the shape of an icy comet made of pure cold iron and connected to a shaft of fine carved ebony. When wielded, a spectral chain and shackle appears connecting the handle of the weapon to the wielder's wrist."
52,"A longsword with an otherworldly, silver colored blade whose edges glow a light blue when swung. The cross guard is relatively wide with rough, uncut, blue, red and yellow diamonds decorating it."
53,"A wooden quarterstaff carved and dyed to look like two entwined asps, one black and one white."
54,"A flail with a clear, almost glass-like head. The head is solid, and cannot be cracked or chipped and contains a small ruby lies at its center. When the weapon strikes a target, it showers the foe in a spray of glittering sparks of pure magical energy. The harmless lights snuff themselves out after a moment's time and never deal any damage."
55,"An unnatural chill rests within the steel of this ^RandomSwordTable^, a terrible frost that burns flesh and freezes the blood, only the strongest of warriors can endure its touch. Although the weapon is numbingly cold to grasp or be struck by, it falls just short of dealing actual cold damage."
56,"A gnarled quarterstaff carved from the blackened heartwood of a hangman's tree. The profane weapon is decorated with the knucklebones of murderers and soaked in the blood of traitorous necromancers."
57,"A heavy flail whose many heads are the gilded skulls of conquered kings, desecrated with mocking imitations of crowns consisting of steel spikes that erupt from the bone. Enemies struck by the skulls are lacerated and savaged by their sharpened teeth and bleed profusely from their wounds."
58,"A beautiful pair of scarab-decorated khopeshes (Shortsword, scimitar or longsword statistics, DM's choice) with gleaming bronze blades inlaid with blued copper in long blood grooves. The tips are hooked and the sharpened edges are on the outside of the blade's curves. The short, circular guards are shaped like scarabs and enamelled in black, with matching black onyx scarabs protruding from the wide, flat pommels. The handles are wood and wrapped in leather that have been dyed black. Both blades have elegant scabbards of sturdy leather stretched over bone frames enamelled blue-black with silver and gold fittings and tiny black scarabs at the tips and by the openings."
59,"The ^RandomSwordTable^ primary feature is a tormented demonic face with curved horns that's set into the hilt with the blade erupting out from the fiend's pained face. The weapon has pronounced barbed hooks on the lower edges and bears an intricate pattern of shimmering orange stripes on the flat sides of the blades."
60,"An ancient sickle imbued with dark power that glows with a pulsing green light."
61,"A heavy mace with an oversized head made from a great hunk taken from an large foundation stone from the base of a skycastle. The great weaponhead is bound with meteoric iron and set on a sturdy shaft of a rough hewn wood."
62,"Aplain-looking silver ^RandomSwordTable^ with a slight hum coming off of the honed edge. Deep grooves are carved into the silver blade, like fractured glass. As the wielder swings it, the grooves light up with a barely-perceptible red light."
63,"A custom-made executioner's hammer with an oversized head and a long, thick haft that only barely counterbalances its weight. The maul is immaculately clean and every facet of the weapon has been well cared for suggesting the executioner was a consummate professional."
64,"An old greataxe that's been battered and stained through long years of hard use. While it shows evidence of many rough 'improvements', the core of its broad-headed blade and cutting edge is of a pure and untarnished metal. The rest of the chunky weapon is bash and cobbled together from other metals in an attempt to make it as fearsome looking as possible. It is a blade that slices armor with its razor edge, before punching through it with its hefty bulk."
65,"An unassuming burlap belt pouch with a touch leather interior that contains a dozen shuriken. The throwing stars sport wickedly curved edges that tear through flesh and leave deep lacerated wounds."
66,"A longbow constructed from the rare and flexible woods of the elven forests, layered with bone and with strings woven from the hair of elf maidens."
67,"A riding lance tipped with a blade carved from the claws of two dozen giant lizards. The jagged serrated ends of the many claws leave ragged wounds that see its victims swiftly bleed to death."
68,"A heavy mace that smolders with a dark power that seems to eat the light around it and devours the warmth of its victims, leaving frigid corpses"
69,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a hooked blade that whispers thoughts of murder and violence to any that grasp its hilt. Its edge never dulls, no matter how many lives it takes."
70,"A curved shortsword with a blade as black as the night sky, with waves that run along the edges when lit only by firelight. Engraved on the weapon are foreign symbols, the likes of which even knowledgeable PC's have never seen. The craftsmanship of this sword is of unparalleled quality and even a casual observer can sense the keenness of the blade. The weapon rests in a plain black scabbard engraved with the same cryptic symbols."
71,"A symbol of a skull within a drop of blood is etched on the grip of the ^AllRandomWeaponTables^. After combat, or any time blood has been spilled, perceptive creatures may notice that pools and drops of blood seem to be running the wrong way, towards the weapon, as if it were calling to the blood. If blood reaches the weapon, it begins to grown warm and emits an unsettling aura of…satisfaction. If the wielder is foolish enough to experiment by purposely dropping more blood on the skull symbol, the weapon becomes heavier, warmer and the wielder feels as though something is moving around inside of it."
72,"A particularly observant creature will notice that the shadows cast by this otherwise ordinary ^AllRandomWeaponTables^ are of the wrong size and shape. They always seems too big, too black, and sometimes move of their own accord."
73,"A long-bladed bastard sword that is wicked in appearance and seems to drip with malice. The blade is made of some sort of bone, carved into a slanted, blunt-tipped blade ideal for reckless hacking and chopping. Long, vicious “teeth” extend down from the blade, perfect for rending and tearing flesh. It is approximately four feet in length and lacking in a proper grip. The handle carved from the bone is wrapped in faded strips of crumbling leather that seem on the verge of peeling away. Looking upon the blade makes a creature's blood boil with the urge to kill."
74,"A steel bladed ^RandomSwordTable^ with a sharp, squared tip. The blade features a decorative “running wolf"" mark and the sword's gilt-iron hilt has a wooden grip bound in wire. The weapon rests in a leather sheath bound in crimson velvet with gold embroidery."
75,"A bardiche (Halberd statistics) consisting of a large, thin, double-edged axe-like blade attached to a four-foot long studded stave with a hand guard."
76,"A broad dagger with razor sharp edges and a handle of solid ivory. The weapon is engraved with ciphers and names of its previous owners. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize some of the names as famous royals and remember a story of a indebted valet who stole a valuable dagger from the prince he was serving but could not sell the blade to pay for his debts because the blade was too recognizable. The distinctive knife was later involved in the killing of a judge and was not recovered afterwards."
77,"A longsword that bears the symbol of a shipwreck on its salt stained grip. The weapon rests in a bronze scabbard and bears a small chain wrapped around the hilt and scabbard-mouth. When the sword is drawn the blade is surrounded in a blurry, shimmering aura as if it was underwater."
78,"An exquisitely crafted ^RandomSwordTable^ with a rounded ivory guard carved in the shape of a crane's head. The relatively simple blade rests in a richly lacquered, sky blue scabbard that is ornamented with fine silver."
79,"A longspear crafted from an unusual green wood and when swung it emits a strange snakelike hissing sound. The weapon hungers for the blood of lions and their kin and the wielder is driven by the need to slaughter any big cats who stand against him."
80,"A long, well made katana, expertly crafted of folded steel with symbols of jade perfectly fused into the metal along the blade's entire length. The handle is carved from polished ebony covered in grey silk stitching."
81,"A wakizashi (Short sword statistics) consisting of a tempered steel blade with a carved ivory hilt and a plain grip, unadorned except for a mesh of silver-gray spider silk."
82,"A slightly short katana with a handle that was originally carved of pearl and ivory, but the handle had blackened over the years from use. A white tassel hangs from the tsuba and darkens over time, taking on darkening hues of red and black. The tassel becomes snow white again each time the sword passes to a new wielder allowing a knowledgeable and perceptive PC to know approximately how long any creature has wielded the blade by seeing how dark the tassel has become. The simple polished wood of the saya is bound by leather at the top, middle and bottom and split down the sides so that the edge of the blade never rests on wood."
83,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade reflects the soul of its wielder, bright and burnished when the bearer's heart was true, dull and tarnished if held by someone without honor. The sword's hilt is wrapped in red silk with a plain black steel guard."
84,"A cutlass (Shortsword, scimitar or longsword statistics, DM's choice) that features a handle coated in black felt and a shiny golden basket hilt engraved with the face of a banshee screaming over a large pirate ship. The blade is made of an enchanted silver that is exceptionally reflective and as durable as steel."
85,"A ^AllRandomWeaponTables^ covered in strange markings that shifted and changed under the viewer's gaze. The chaotic forms appear wildly different from one creature to another varying from, runes geometric designs or hieroglyphics. The grip is wrapped in the hide of some unknown beast and feels warm under the wielder's hands."
86,"An ornate katana with a drop-shaped ruby on the blade's hilt. The weapon's sheath is made from red wood so dark it seemed almost black, the top half adorned with strands of red and bronze-colored silk, tightly woven around it. Simple plates of a dark golden color made up the bottom end of the sheath."
87,"A magnificent longspear with a shaft of silver-grey wood and a razor-sharp steel head engraved with intricate representations of wind, clouds, and lightning."
88,"A longbow made of plain ash-wood that is slightly warm to the touch. The bow is asymmetric and the grip is positioned at about two thirds of the distance from the upper tip."
89,"An exceptionally tall composite bow that would surpass the height of most human archers. It is composed of bamboo, wood and leather that have been laminated together and is strung with a hemp line."
90,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a golden handle an elaborate dragon design racing down the steel in gold. The hilt is wrapped in scarlet threads and the bamboo scabbard is inscribed with symbols of elemental fire."
91,"A large black-iron warhammer that hums with a dark, sinister magic."
92,"A battleaxe whose twin blades are forged in the likeliness of howling wolves. Matching stones the colour of blood are inlaid into the hafts of the axes, which flare to life with crimson fire when the axes drink of the blood of their enemies."
93,"A trident crafted from black brass with small bolts of blue lightning that occasionally skitter around the tines."
94,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a plainly adorned hilt and guard made of bloodstained gold. The scabbard is covered in etchings of skeletons, fire, and scenes of mayhem. The blade appears to encourage its bearer to unconsciously, yet pathologically lie and sow discord and distrust even when its not in the bearer's best interest to do so. Although the bearer will never violate any strongly help moral values nor will he put himself in immediate jeopardy by lying, he will make attempts to obscure the truth whenever possible. The bearer remembers his lies and may comes to his senses and stop carrying the weapon at which point the dishonest compulsion immediately ends."
95,"A composite bow built from a mixture of wood, horn, and sinew glued together. The stave is tinted a greenish-yellow and heavily grooved, giving the impression it was crafted from the scale of a great serpent. The straight grip is covered with a woven reddish brown strand of leather. At both ends the bow bends and extended before curving in the other direction, giving it a great deal of draw strength."
96,"A pair of humble looking handaxes with long wooden handles and red wedge heads."
97,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade was forged over a fire of starving souls. Its edges are worked into a thousand tiny mouths, each studded with spiny teeth and rasping tongues. When it strikes a victim, its leaves jagged, uneven lacerations more akin to an animal's bite than a blade's slash. When the weapon is used to cut flesh, the wound always results in a vivid, blood red scar, regardless of how it heals."
98,"A long, narrow-bladed dagger that lacks a guard, but its blade flares out at the top, providing a surface against which the hand can rest. The handle is smooth ebony carved with a crosshatch pattern for better grip. The dagger has no pommel. The blade itself is as dark as iron except for its edge, which glitters almost silver. The runes etched down its length seem reddened, as if they had been rusted into the metal. Anyone familiar with weaponry will realize at once that this blade is meant for stabbing rather than slicing or parrying. It is the weapon of an assassin and cries out to be used."
99,"A massive, greatclub ringed with bands of cursed iron, and carries enchantments of shattering and destruction. Ancient and terrible, its outline blurs with a barely restrained thirst for carnage."
100,"A masterfully made, gilded longsword with the house symbol of the king of the realm stamped into the grip. Only a handful of superbly cut gems decorate the crossguard and pommel, managing to create a regal look that is neither tastelessly gaudy nor feigning modesty. Etched on the flats of the blade in flowing calligraphy is the phrase “Forged In The Hope I Need Never Be Used”. Despite the wishes of the blade and its obviously decorative appearance, the sword is well balanced, sharp edged and perfectly serviceable as a combat weapon. Knowledgeable PC's will have heard descriptions of this weapon and recognize it as the personal sword of the currently ruling king."
