1,"A black headband with a silver forehead protector inscribed with the symbol of a leaf."
2,"An inconspicuous set of wooden prayer beads carved with religious symbols all relating to ^GoodDomains^ and strung on a hempen cord. Upon close investigation, an extremely perceptive observer fingering the beads may notice that two beads adjacent to one another have been hollowed out and a garrote has been secreted inside. Braided silk cord is kept spooled within the beads and the bearer can tug on the beads (As an action equivalent to drawing a weapon), separating them and exposing the garrote which he is then considered wielding."
3,"A one-inch high pewter elf soldier, armed with a shield and longsword; the base reads “4 of 7”."
4,"A beautifully rug made of intricately woven patterns that somehow seem far more unsettling than they should. Perceptive PC's can tell that the carpet has a hidden design of a demonic face woven into its fabric that can only be seen by staring “through” it, and not actually focusing on the face."
5,"A wedding veil of pale, faded beige that hangs from a dainty crown of mottled brown feathers. Appearing at a distance to be lace, on closer inspection the material is a delicate array of branching veins much like the intricate remains of a partially decomposed leaf."
6,"A thumbnail-sized jacinth carved in the form of a phoenix with upraised wings."
7,"A tightly woven beige linen sack containing ten pounds of salt. A stylized rose is drawn on the sack's center in black ink."
8,"A bright white, woman's bonnet with a pink silk ribbon tied around the front into a delicate bow. Embroidered stitching on the inside of the bonnet reads, “All is not what it seems.”"
9,"A beautifully-woven patterned silk and wool carpet from the exotic southern city of Sabtah."
10,"A corpse of a cranium rat that has been specially prepared. Its insides have been hollowed out and stuffed with various Underdark herbs and shreds of papyrus containing esoteric symbols."
11,"A battered and tattered black leather trench coat with ten shiny brass buttons."
12,"A battered, tarnished electrum piece. The coin is perfectly round and has a clear heads and tails but when flipped, it always lands on its edge."
13,"A bizarre slate of glossy, red rock which resembles no other type of rock known on the material plane. It constantly emits a faint and high-pitched hum and occasionally sheds needle-like shards of flame-red glass which vanish as they fall from it. The stone casts no shadow and when viewed in direct sunlight, a chamber is visible within, as if the slate is a box of darkened glass containing a morass of shifting figures."
14,"A black leather slave collar with two dozen inward facing, one-inch long steel spikes."
15,"A black leather tube containing a portrait of the founder of the region's chief criminal organization pleasantly smiling. Not much is known about the portrait or who made it, but there is an intensity to it that puts everyone in its presence on edge. The eyes of the portrait don't always seem to match with the direction they were looking last time."
16,"A black velvet evening dress carefully rolled up and wrapped in linen."
17,"A bronze salver engraved with a cornucopia design."
18,"A lead coin of the Old City, that's ancient beyond reckoning, though virtually untarnished. If dropped, it rolls towards the nearest entrance of the Old City, likely straight back into the sewer from which it was dredged."
19,"A clear crystal decanter wrapped with a spiral of pewter wire."
20,"A crude map of the local area inscribed on a tattered canvas scroll, that bears an “X” marking an area near where the map was found. There is a list of instructions in the bottom corner of the map: Find the shipwrecked pirate vessel, then go north-west 2-3 miles, until you find the swift-running river. From there, go south 1-2 miles until you find the old abandoned mill, and you'll find the plunder hidden behind an old painting. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end. The map could easily be a prank, trap, confidence scheme, ambush or the area could already have been stripped of any value by other adventurers."
21,"A crystal vial filled with silvery holy water and sealed with a beaten copper stopper."
22,"A cunning, dwarven contraption that uses canvas and several hinged, metal legs to create a stable, backless seat that can be easily tightly folded up and packed. For an army on the move this kind of folding stool is a luxury, as seats are in short supply in a mobile army camp."
23,"A one gallon cask of Flaming Dragon, a spicy beer that causes the drinker to breathe small spurts of fire when they burp."
24,"A double layered jute pouch containing 3d6 small, deep pink, crystalline beads with hints of blue around their edges. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gems as tourmalines."
25,"An unusual stringed instrument known as a hurdy-gurdy that uses a wheel-crank and keys to produce sound. It is a small, long box that rests on the player's lap or knees and is played by turning the crank and pressing the keys. It is a very popular instrument for performing dance music."
26,"A drinking-jack of deep red, translucent horn bound in lacquered black iron, hung from a rawhide cord."
27,"A five-foot square tarp of treated otterskin, backed with plant oils and alchemical derivatives. The tarp can be wrapped around an object to provide a water-tight seal without altering or damaging the protected item."
28,"A fist-sized blue-green stone with tiny red flecks crudely carved to suggest a patrician visage. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the object as bloodstone."
29,"A flattering portrait of Lord Locher, ruler of the Lonely Coast, in a plain wooden frame."
30,"A hand mirror with beautiful gold leafing on the frame. The face of the mirror is slightly varnished. After looking into the mirror for a while, shadowy figures can be seen reflected behind the person viewing the mirror. If they look behind them there is nothing there, but once they look at the mirror again, the figures are closer and there are more in the room."
31,"A fluffy shawl made from two dozen grey squirrel pelts."
32,"A golden candle that bears the symbol of a specific deity of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ emblazoned on its surface, surrounded by the iconography of that deity's faith."
33,"A hairnet formed from a wide mesh of white gold thread."
34,"A hand sized marble sundial with each number on its face comes from a different alphabet. A polished bone protrudes from the center, and a carving of twelve humanoids of various races, holding hands, surrounds it. Beneath the bone, a wooden plaque reads “In time, we are all joined in the grave”."
35,"A keymaking set that includes all the tools necessary for its owner to make a working copy of a key in their possession or of which they have obtained an impression. The set includes two wax impression blocks, as well as an assortment of small, incredibly sharp knives, blank keys, tiny files of all shapes, and polishing cloths of different coarseness. When a key is pressed into one of the blocks of soft wax, a qualified craftsman can use the impression to make a working copy without having the actual key in hand. The wax impression block allows the bearer to carry the key-print to a location of solitude where the key itself can be created. Making a key requires about ten minutes of uninterrupted work. A creature proficient in thieves tools or tinkers tools is also proficient in keymaking sets."
36,"A large marble of dark glass that swirls with shadows, occasionally taking the form of a twisted, screaming face."
37,"A large round electrum coin, depicting Queen Meritamon of Khemet on one side and a sphinx on the reverse."
38,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of a well-stocked confectionery shop bustling with children. The container is filled with dozens of red, strawberry flavored, hard candies."
39,"A large wooden chest carved with images of the Summer and Winter Courts of the Fey."
40,"A leaf-shaped silver coin, depicting an elf queen on the obverse, and a pair of unicorns rampant on the reverse."
41,"A leather pouch containing 3d6 smooth silver discs, each decorated with a different rune of the Dwarven alphabet."
42,"A leather wallet stamped with the symbol of an alembic pouring spirits into a keg, that contains a full set of certified identification papers denoting that the bearer is a member of the brewers and distillers guild. The section containing the member's physical description (Height, weight, sex, race, eye, skin and hair color) is completely blank and could be filled in by anyone with half decent handwriting."
43,"A many-layered affair mountaineer's outfit consisting of light inner shirts and trousers, heavy, waterproof trousers, a vest, heavy shirt, cloak, belt, boots and a sturdy hat. This outfit allows the traveler to respond quickly to the changing conditions of mountain weather."
44,"A mask resembling the visage of an old halfling woman that when donned, causes the bearer to glimpse the very moment of their birth."
45,"A masterfully crafted halfling fiddle."
46,"A one gallon cask of Salty Dog Ale, a dark, rich brew that reminds the drinker of the sea. Knowledgeable PC's know that plopping in the shell of a sea snail for good luck is customary and adds a fitting salinity to the drink."
47,"A painting depicting an elf military commander who is overlooking a battlefield strewn with dead orcs and elves; beside him, a woman weeps."
48,"A painting of a large tree with many spreading branches which cover the entire upper half of the picture, some of them even extending out onto the frame. Each leaf is made of finely detailed gold or silver leaf, and they flutter in the slightest breeze."
49,"A pair of matching bangles carved from fragrant red sandalwood."
50,"A pair of mortal brains, preserved in labelled glass jars of formaldehyde: one of a corrupted saint who died while experiencing pure hatred, and one of a redeemed evildoer who died while experiencing pure compassion."
51,"A pair of purple samite curtains woven with flowers in golden thread."
52,"A pair of quartz bookends shaped like seated knights holding miniature steel swords."

55,"A piece of irregularly-shaped granite sporting a dense, haphazard spray of colorless, obelisk-shaped crystals."
56,"A pointy wizard's hat of dark blue felt, embroidered in silver thread with stars and mystic symbols."
57,"A rectangular steel plate meant to be held to the bearer's chest (Even over armor) with leather straps. Engravings of battling warriors cover the plate, and whenever the bearer enters combat, the engraved figures animate and begin fighting each other."
58,"A red stone with a touch of orange to its color, nearly opaque but for a faint translucency visible at its edges. It has been expertly worked into the size and shape of a small apple. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gemstone as carnelian."
59,"A rose shaped, red glass brooch that emits a pleasant, floral smell."
60,"A short staff whose head features the holy symbol of a forgotten Goblin God of Bravery, who has not been worshipped in a thousand years or more. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that over the years, the disappearance of this god has changed both the Goblin race; they've become cowardly and weak, a shadow of their former selves, focusing on surviving and escaping from danger, instead of charging forward into the fray."
61,"A rosewood jewelry box decorated in gold leaf with scenes of the City of Brass."
62,"A scrimshaw covered ivory scroll case. Its carvings depict nautical battle scenes."
63,"A set of three scarves woven with brightly colored cloth. When stretched out together they depict a beautiful rainbow."
64,"A signal horn made of polished brass and shaped like a curving ram's horn. Sigils are stamped along its rim and a chain of golden links is the carrying strap."
65,"A silver bracelet set with large fire opal."
66,"A silk cloth map showing underground trade routes and passages, including the location of the abandoned drow city of Dol Felezzan."
67,"A silver flagon shaped like a rearing pegasus with red amber eyes."
68,"A small, jointed, wood and cloth doll made to resemble a featureless, humanoid creature. The mannequin is incredibly basic, lacking fingers, toes, hair or other defining characteristics."
69,"A silver-rimmed bone cup inlaid with mother of pearl."
70,"A small cloth bag containing 4d4 small, cloudy, faceted gems, pale purple in color with dark bands running parallel to their various faces. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the stones as amethysts."
71,"A single silver chime with an open door symbol etched on the side."
72,"A small brass statuette of a harp-playing lillend, painted with bright metallic colors."
73,"A small, metallic, alien cube with a cut-out that exposes mechanical features, tubing and lights. The central light appears to be modelled after a face."
74,"A small, simple blade attached to a bracket that sits uncomfortably behind the wielder's ear. Although extremely difficult to operate with skill, ear blades are designed to cut the rope of the hangman's noose as it begins to constrict around the bearer's neck. They rarely work as advertised but a small chance is certainly better than none. A rigorous search of the bearer will quickly reveal the ear blades, while the casual glance would not. If a wielder is ever hanged while wearing an ear blade, he may attempt to maneuver the blade so that it cuts the rope and sets him free."
75,"A small, squat glass decanter that has a 20 oz (600ml) capacity. The vessel has a base ringed by a bronze band, and is capped by a heavy bronze and cork stopper."
76,"A smooth oval of clear, hard resin with the flat image of an eye suspended inside."
77,"A spyglass with an extendable copper tube used to view distant objects. The glass on the inside is broken, rendering the device useless, but it could be repaired and made serviceable again."
78,"A square bottle which contains transparent greenish fluid and a miniature evergreen tree resting at the bottom of the container. When uncorked it smells of fresh air and the forest."

80,"A thick branch of yew wood with druidic symbols etched along its entire surface."
81,"A thick glass jar containing a pint of an alchemical concoction useful for preserving organic tissue for long periods of time. The embalming fluid can be used to preserve a pound of material for a year, after which it will be necessary to drain the preservative fluid and replace it with a fresh solution."
82,"A thumb sized oval stone whose milky translucency scintillates as light plays across its faceted surface. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gem as chrysoberyl."
83,"A tortoiseshell pick for a lute or similarly stringed instrument. One edge has been ground down to a fine point."
84,"A translucent faceted gem, nearly the size of a fist that changes from blue to purple and back again as light passes through its surface. A knowledgeable PC can identify the mineral as alexandrite."
85,"A ^RandomColourTable^, wool tunic that smells of fish and saltwater."
86,"A two foot tall idol of gilded copper, depicting a nude human female. The figure possesses two pairs of feathered wings and three heads: an antelope, a lioness and a gryphon."
87,"A two-foot by two-foot by three-foot wooden box with cranks built into two sides and the top. Known as a brick press, it allows the user to compress mud or clay into building bricks if he has the time and desire. Additionally, it allows for the creation of 'fuel bricks' from sawdust, peat moss or animal waste. These bricks allow you to maintain a normal fire in situations where one might not be able to find wood for fuel. A creature can easily make two bricks per minute and they must dry for a few hours in the sun or less near a fire before they are ready to be transported."
88,"A wall hanging of a polished behir hide stretched across darkwood frame."
89,"A white satin whalebone corset in excellent condition without snags or discoloration. It has been carefully wrapped in several layers of felt."

93,"A wool and cotton woven kilim (An exquisitely woven rug) decorated with geometric shapes and animal designs."
94,"An alabaster lamp of translucent cream stone carved in the shape of a lion with a hollow body to contain oil. If used, it functions as a common lamp."
95,"An egg-sized orb of compressed powder that PC's knowledgeable in alchemy or the performing arts will recognize as a Flash Bomb. Originally developed by alchemists as a showpiece for entertainers, this one was made by cultists of the local saint of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ and when it is thrown into a fire it flashes into the saint's divine symbol that's 10-feet-tall and 20-feet wide,. The flash of white light lasts only an instant but leaves a bright divine-symbol-shaped spot in the vision of all who view it. Creatures within 20 feet of the flash's center suffer disadvantage on visual perception checks and ranged attacks for 1d4 rounds. The orb can be fired from a sling as easily as one might launch a bullet or can be thrown accurately into a five foot area within 30 feet. Knowledgeable PC's know that the cultists of that saint have recently garnered a poor reputation due to their strongarm preaching methods and throwing these bombs into places and business that are morally opposite of the saint's ideals."
96,"An elongated shoulder pad that enables a falconer to carry his raptor on his shoulder, eliminating the need to wear a glove or carry a cumbersome free-standing perch. Cushioned and lined with wood and metal, it protects against the falcon's talons while at the same time giving it a comfortable place to rest when not flying."
97,"An extremely graphic love letter between a demon and one of the Fair Folk, mentioning myriad unknown orifices and appendages. Equal parts arousing and grotesque; oddly touching in places."
98,"An ivory wand, carved in a helical braid that's wraps around a pristine white pearl near the tip before coming to a point."
99,"An elven lyre that produces a calming, exquisite sound, and is prized by bards of any race. The resonance box is semi-spherical and supports two arms that curve inwards, with a crossbar keeping from four to eight strings taut."
100,"An ivory scroll case whose off-white cylindrical surface is marked by gold wire inlay giving shape to a simple labyrinth design. Prying off one of the stitched leather end caps reveals a number of rolled sheets of linen paper, each bearing painstakingly neat handwriting describing gourmet recipes."
