1,"A dagger whose blade shines an iridescent purple hue. There is a piece of parchment wrapped around the handle that reads: “This is the blade that will kill you.” Once any PC reads the note, the dagger teleports away."
2,"A crescent moon-shaped, frontward curving blade (Bastard sword statistics) about two and a half feet long. Its thick handle is nearly as long as the blade, making it half-sword, half-scythe. The weapon (Known as an arakh) grants the wielder tremendous manoeuvrability of the wrists and the ability to hook the tip of the blade behind armor and limbs during battle."
3,"A large mechanical contraption known as a rivebow, designed for someone with murder and mayhem in mind. Functionally equivalent to a heavy crossbow this weapon fire spinning chakram rather than bolts. The sharpened (Often serrated) disks are launched with such force that they can sever an arm clean in half or neatly decapitate a human. Some pirates and ocean reavers have taken to using them during hostile boarding as the spinning blades cut through rope and sails crippling the enemy ship."
4,"A quiver containing a dozen long arrows, fletched in black and yellow like a hornet. The tips have two angry curly steel barbs welded to it producing vicious wounds."
5,"A long sword of workmanlike grey steel. It doesn't have much in the way of ornamental flourishes, but there is a fearsome beauty about it still, to the eye. The beauty of a thing fitted perfectly to its purpose. Knowledgeable PC's can recognize the maker's mark as a Calvez, forged by the best swordsmith of the far-flung land of Styria."
6,"A brass handled spiked shield made from a huge conch shell, that's as durable as steel."
7,"A matching pair of hatchets (Handaxe statistics), each a foot and a half in length, with leather-wrapped handles and straight black blades that narrow like scalpels. They are balanced with balls of blackened steel, each as wide around as a silver coin."
8,"A shortsword with a triangular blade sharpened on one side like an oversized chef's knife. The metal blade is lodged into a long piece of whalebone and reinforced by tree roots. The weapon produces a faint but distinctive humming 'song' that the spiritually perceptive can hear."
9,"A city guard's shortbow made of hickory wood. The grip is unwrapped, but smooth and comfortable from regular use. The bowstring is made of dull brown leather. Accompanying the bow is a two-fingered archer's glove, made of pebbled brown calfskin."
10,"A sealed ceramic jar filled with a few dozen envenomed caltrops. Each one is a small, razored piece of hardened glass, tough enough to pierce any boot sole and small enough to be overlooked. A typical caltrop point that's driven through leather is apt to have any venom wiped from it but the weapon-smiths who wrought these particular works of devilry included shallow wells along each spike, reservoirs where toxins were smeared, waiting to be washed out with blood. In addition to the normal injuries inflicted by caltrops, these weapons deal poison damage equivalent to a dagger (1d4). The caltrops are reasonably fragile making them difficult to gather back up and their poison dries to uselessness an hour after the jar's seal is broken."
11,"A balanced yet oddly heavy rapier with a hilt wrapped in copper wire. In the pommel is set a high-domed cabochon of garnet, and a ragged leaf picked out in carnelian ornaments the blade on either flat."
12,"A battleaxe whose obsidian blades are shaped like spread wings of a bird of prey. The haft is made of pale bone with purple sigils carved along its length, ending in a large black talon."
13,"A beautifully crafted crossbow of gnomish make, decorated with engravings of dice, cards and prayers unto Gond."
14,"A black eyepatch that can be used as a sling as a last resort. Disturbingly enough, the weapon can fire glass eyes as ammunition as easily as firing typical sling bullets."
15,"A bloodied dagger wrapped in a piece of parchment. The parchment details the death of a righteous woman, who volunteered to die in place of an innocent."
16,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ that is quasi-sentient and has a semblance of feelings. Occasionally, in situations of high stress, these feelings “leak” from the weapon and spill over everyone within ten feet. Only a detailed magical examination reveals the source of these feelings."
17,"A bloodstained ritualist's dagger set with a blade of steel and a hilt wrapped in pewter wire. A small rounded copper pommel provides balance and a decorative element."
18,"A brown halberd bearing a long animal tail wrapped around its top half, with two yellow lines around the end before being topped by a white fluff. Two more yellow strips wrap around the center of the shaft, and the pommel is a three-pronged metal spike. The yellow strips will shine iridescently when they catch the light."
19,"A butcher's cleaver (Handaxe statistics) with jagged notches and scrapes all along its blade from heavy use. When it hasn't spilt blood for over a day, the cleaver begins to rapidly deteriorate, its blade becoming dull and lined with rust. When the weapon deals damage to a creature that has blood, the cleaver sucks up some of the blood it spills, returning to pristine condition."
20,"A dagger weighted for throwing and crafted out of a metal not seen often in the materiel realms. When viewed in shadows or very low light it glows with nothingness and the pure emptiness of the void."
21,"A clear longsword made from a strange, emblem inscribed gemlike material with a cut gem as the pommel."
22,"A club decorated with large teeth and carved with stylized images of wild animals."
23,"A comically long recorder that's long and sturdy enough to be wielded as a functioning quarterstaff."
24,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ whose handle is made out of bone and teeth and wrapped in crudely stitched, badly cured leather. When the wielder kills a living creature droplets of their blood crawls up the length of the weapon and onto the wielder's hands, like small warm leeches, where they are quickly absorbed into the wielder's skin."
25,"A composite bow fashioned from horn, sinew and glues. Its power comes from a series of pulleys, cams, and levers. They do not warp and can be adjusted for a variety of conditions."
26,"A dagger housed inside a sheath made of scuffed and scratched leather. The weapon itself has a slightly curved blade inlaid with gold in a savage and spiky pattern. The hilt is in the shape, albeit distorted, of the shoulders (crossguard), neck (hilt) and head (pommel) of a fearsome looking humanoid who, if the design is investigated, will be revealed as a fire giant. The pommel is inset with two rubies, about a quarter of an inch across, which glow vividly if illuminated. Its name, in the pattern of sigils on its blade is Gwaltashar."
27,"A dark halberd adorned with serpentine designs. Taking the blood-soaked shaft of the weapon in hand sends a sudden chill along the wielder's spine."
28,"A dark leather quiver containing two dozen black-shafted arrows. Each one possesses a wedge-shaped ivory tip and dark red sinew binds the arrowhead to the shaft."
29,"A dagger with copper wire wound around hilt and cabochon malachite pommel."
30,"A darkwood greatclub decorated with elongated screaming faces, skulls, thorny briars and chains."
31,"A dented, chipped, and dirty greatsword. Its hilt is black with some worn leather grip-straps and a red gemstone in the pommel."
32,"A distinctive double-edged cavalry spear with a wide blade, intricately inscribed with the family history of a noble knight."
33,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ whose handle was made from an iron horseshoe. Holding it causes the wielder to feel as if the odds are in their favour"
34,"A five foot long oaken staff, masterfully carved at the top into four faces: One is the face of an old, strong, bearded man, made of leaves. The others are the head of a wolf, an eagle, and a shark."
35,"A glaive whose blade is made out of an opaque, glass-like material, which glows in a teal hue. The polearm's grip is made of white wood, with snake-like leviathans etched into it. On the bottom of the grip are multiple red bands, and a golden necklace with small, golden pearls and a symbol of the world tree Yggdrasil hanging on it."
36,"A gnomish made shortsword that is exceptionally-well balanced, with that perfectly fits its wielder's hands. The razor-sharp blade curves right at the tip, allowing for a smoother cut so that the wielder can reposition themselves quickly to land another blow."
37,"A greatbow (Longbow statistics) made of yew wood sporting a grip wrapped in navy cotton. The bowstring is made of pebbled black deer leather."
38,"A halberd bearing a long axe blade in front with a long, looping back hook designed to unhorse riders."
39,"A hand crossbow with grips made of human bone,. All the metal in its construction is black, pitted, and marked with dull red flecks."
40,"A heavy crossbow covered with dwarven inscriptions. The elegant stock has been carved to resemble the head of a hammer."
41,"A heavy pickaxe with a steel haft and a head made of dark iron. The petrified tooth of a black dragon is embedded directly through the head, serving as the weapon's nearly indestructible point."
42,"A heavy, two-handed flail consisting of a roughly hewn wooden haft lashed with gut and rope to a hefty boulder."
43,"A katana with a hilt wrapped in red cloth and a golden tsuba with indentions at the four corners and crescent markings on the sides of the blade. The scabbard is charcoal-black."
44,"A longsword measuring 40 inches and weighing no more than 35 ounces. The blade is sharp as a razor and covered in mysterious runic signs that gives it a bluish colour. With a little practice, the wielder could shave with it. The 12 inch long handle is wrapped in strips of salamander skin, has a cylindrical copper cap which serves as a pommel. The hilt, although quite small, is quite ornate. The weapon is beautiful in every respects and whistles as it flashes through the air with the lightest touch."
45,"A longsword whose blade has red and black ripples through the steel and its scabbard is garishly decorated with gold, cherrywood and red leather with golden lions' heads set with ruby eyes. The two colors of the blade lap over one another without ever touching, each ripple distinct, like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore."
46,"A magnificent longbow made from the wood of a silver oak tree. When fired, it leaves painless splinters in the wielder's hands. The silver coloured wooden fragments work themselves deeper and deeper into the bearer's flesh if not removed until they finally disappear under the skin never to be seen again."
47,"A longsword whose blade shines like polished silver, remaining perfectly reflective no matter what punishments it endures. Blue and silver flames lick incessantly along the blade, quillons, and pommel, and they harmlessly surround the wielder's hands whenever the blade is drawn. At the seat of the blade is an Elven rune meaning “Weapon”."
48,"A longsword whose hilt is wrought in the shape of a bow and arrow, with the pommel fashioned as arrow fletching, and the crossguard forming the limbs of the bow. The scabbard has been carved from wood with a large gnarl in the center. The wood itself is largely left uncovered and undecorated, leaving a unique pattern that evokes a forest theme."
49,"A longsword with a hilt made of carved black wood with a crossguard in the shape of a human leg bone. It rests in a scabbard of black leather, decorated with silver fittings and studded with small carved pieces of jet."
50,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade is a deep, opaque black, with ribbons and ripples of incandescent green fire pulsing within the surface of the blade. While the blade itself seems centuries old, the hilt appears as though it has been replaced several times over the years."
51,"A long-handled greataxe, bristling with half a dozen sharp spikes and a flaring blade big enough to split a tree."
52,"A longspear carved from the fire blackened bone of a dire bear. It is shod with adamantine and capped with the polished and gleaming stinger of a manticore."
53,"A longsword with a steel core clad with silver, the edges also of steel, pure silver is too soft to sharpen it enough. On the cross guard and down the full length of the blade are runic signs, that are nearly impossible to decipher, but surely magical. If translated, the arcane glyphs read; “My brilliance cuts the gloom, my light dispels the darkness.”"
54,"A massive greatclub that appears to be made of a series of stones welded together, with spiked chunks of rock scattered liberally across the surface. Although crude in appearance, the weapon is flexible, and does not suffer from the fragility of most stone weapons."
55,"A massive greatsword that is essentially two longswords forged into one. The blades cross over each other twice, once in the middle, then once again at the end of the blade. The pattern resembles a zigzag rather than a gentle curve. One half the blade is a bluish tint, while the other half is greenish."
56,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade is dented, chipped, and dirty. Its hilt is black with some worn leather grip-straps and a red gemstone in the pommel."
57,"A massive two-handed mace made entirely of thorium, obviously intended only for the strongest of wielders. The weapon is extremely large and heavy bordering on being unusable. The mace is entirely black in color, save for silver metal spikes jutting out from the thick, malicious head."
58,"A massively oversized sewing needle created by some race of unimaginable large giants. The objects functions as a knight's lance without issue."
59,"A quarterstaff made of oak, inlaid with masterful knotwork. One end of the staff is inlaid with cold iron, and the other end silver, both set flush with the wood.  This makes it an effective weapon against fey who are harmed by iron, werewolves who are harmed by silver."
60,"A masterfully crafted fencing rapier of exquisite beauty that is perfectly shaped and balanced for a right handed wielder who has six fingers on said appendage."
61,"A menacing greatsword with large serrations along both cutting edges. Dried blood is caked into the serrations. The wielder feels a hunger for battle while holding this weapon."
62,"A mithril throwing hammer with ornate dwarven runes and ornamental blue gem inlays. The head is topped with a cabochon-cut blue jasper and hilt inlaid with lapis lazuli bands. The runes name the hammer “Truesilver's Kiss”."
63,"A moldy burlap quiver containing a dozen shoddy arrows, each one forged from rusted scrap. They seem designed to break off inside of the body, leaving flakes of the fouled iron behind to cause tetanus and infection."
64,"A mundane looking ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ with dark coloring. Any blood that touches the weapon is quickly absorbed into it, leaving no trace behind. Vein-like glowing red lines appear at the point of contact with the blood, streak towards the grip. The red lines appear to flow into the wielder's hand causing them to glow dimly for a few moments before the light fades away."
65,"A neglected, steel-bladed rapier, with a hilt wrapped in brown calfskin. The pommel consists only of a lanyard ring and the basket has the appearance of spiderwebs. The weapon rests in a scabbard of pecan wood inlaid with narwhal horn."

67,"A quarterstaff made of black wood, adorned with carvings of runes representing stars, darkness, and night. The ends are capped with black onyx."
68,"A pair of handaxes with a strange design. They have long, thin handles that bulge like bulbs at the end and the axe heads are narrow and thin, almost like picks. The hafts of the weapons have a flowing, organic design and not of a uniform width, made of some dark red wood, painted with colorful dots down the sides."
69,"A plain and unassuming ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ of dark, almost black, steel. Its leather grip is darkened from sweat and age. It has no magical properties whatsoever, nor can it ever be enchanted by magic."
70,"A quarterstaff made of spongy, dark wood that leaves visible red stains on everything it touches. Holding the staff causes a light stinging sensation wherever it touches the skin. It's obviously, unnatural evil and makes beasts visibly uncomfortable and wild animal will not willingly approach the wielder unless starving or threatened. If the staff is broken or burned, it releases a terrible, inhuman scream, causing all plants that can hear it to wither."
71,"A quiver of barghest fur with pebbled brown snakeskin trim. It contains 21 crossbow bolts with shafts of hickory wood painted gray and fletching of two blue feathers and one rose feather."
72,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ bearing the symbol of a gladiator's arena etched into the grip. The bearer always feels as though they are being watched by a crowd of people interested in witnessing the bloodsport of combat. The weapon emits a burst of applause and cheering noises equivalent to a large crowd of people whenever the weapon is drawn, successfully critically hits a target or is used to kill or incapacitate an enemy. The weapon emits a burst of jeers, hisses and boos that are just as loud whenever the wielder critically misses, is disarmed or becomes incapacitated by an enemy."
73,"A flat sword known a tular set with a blade of all straight lines that flares outward and is more than twice as wide at the end than at the hilt. It rests in a scabbard that's open all along its length and has to be drawn sideways to accommodate the oddly shaped blade."
74,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a shining crystal blade with small approximations of the planets orbiting it. Knowledgeable PC's will notice an extra unknown planet floating parallel to the PC's planet, perpetually out of sight behind the sun, which the blade likely represents. The mystery planet is about the same distance away from the blade as the PC's planet, suggesting that it could support similar types of life."
75,"A reliable sideword (Shortsword statistics) made of a steady, well tested pattern, mass produced by sand casting, minimally sanded down, quickly sharpened, wrapped in inexpensive materials and shipped to the buyer. Knowledgeable, well-traveled or veteran PC's will have seen dozens of these identical swords over their lifetime and know them to be infamous for being as cheaply made as humanly possible without compromising its basic integrity and function. The weapon and its thousands of identical siblings are popular amongst militias, guardsman and the basic footsoldier and is sometimes known as the “Unsalted mashed potatoes,” of melee weaponry."
76,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a slightly curving blade of exceptional craftsmanship, that bears a light blue tint. The sword's pommel is wrapped with smooth leather straps that wind themselves about the wielder's hands in combat, allowing him to keep a tight and even grip on his weapon"
77,"A rattlesnake-skin whip is tipped with the filed-down fangs of several snakes."
78,"A scimitar with an obsidian blade and a gold hilt embedded with purple gems. Harmless black flames lick against the inward curve to form the shape of feathers, mimicking a bird's wing."
79,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^  covered with intricate designs that have strange, shifting optical qualities and are never fully still."
80,"A shining, beautiful bastard sword with a cruciform and slender, well-weighted hilt, ending in a spherical pommel made of white metal. The blade is coated in a layer of alchemical silver and the weapon rests in a black enameled sheath made to be worn over the shoulder."
81,"A sickly curved sickle cast in the form of a segmented spider's leg. The leather wrapped handle contains a hollow recess that can hold a single dose of poison. Filling the reservoir requires an action equivalent to attacking that carries the usual risks of poisoning yourself. Once filled, the reservoir keeps the blade saturated and viable for up to one hour. The first successful attack made with the spider-leg sickle during this time administers and expends the dose of poison."
82,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ created during the heyday of a fallen human kingdom. Its markings tie it to a heroic human of legend whose exploits border on myth. Careful inspection reveals writing on the weapon in a forgotten tongue whose significance is lost to the ages."
83,"A sigil-branded longbow carved from a yew branch, and strung with twisted rawhide."
84,"A single, razor-edged longsword with a slender, gleaming red blade, its length inscribed with designs of cloaked figures and tall scythes, accentuated by a black blood trough running along its center. Its hilt resembles whitened vertebrae that end in a skull-bobbed pommel. Running from it toward the crosspiece, the hilt is carved to resemble a backbone and rib-cage, and the crosspiece itself resembled a pelvic skeleton, with legs spread out wide and bent back toward the head, so that the wielder's hand fits neatly within the 'bony' boundaries. All of the pommel, hilt and crosspiece is white, like bleached bones—perfectly white, except for the eye sockets of the skull pommel, which are like black pits at one moment and flare with red fires the next."
85,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ of Abyssal design that emits a faint sulphurous odour and emits a thrill of exhilaration within the wielder whenever he knowingly breaks a law."
86,"A slender shortsword with a blade of mirror-bright steel. Its hilt, of a darker and frosted steel, mounts a grip of ivory wrapped in braided crimson silk and a knuckle-guard of coiling, thorned arcs of magically-hardened gold. Set in the pommel is a garnet cabochon etched with petals and thorns."
87,"A slightly oversized sickle whose blade is hooked to a vicious curved point resembling the beak of a hawk."
88,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^  that is covered in crystalline gems each cut into the shape of a striking blue eye. Whenever the weapon is used to kill, the eyes weep tears of pure water."
89,"A slim and elegant dagger that resembles a miniature rapier with a long needle-like apex. It weighs half as much as a normal dagger. Emblazoned in gold on the hilt is the symbol of a kingfisher."
90,"A small curved handaxe made of solid silver, covered in abstract arabesques."
91,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that is half the weight of a normal example of its kind. The object is inscribed with feathered wings, suns, and other symbols of good. Fiends find the weapon's presence repulsive."
92,"Needler: A druid-crafted bow that appears to be only a slightly curved, gnarled branch at first glance. Further inspection reveals it to be a magically crafted longbow of living wood with a string of braided vines. The bow sprouts pale pink flowers throughout the day. The flowers begin to bud by morning, fully sprouting by afternoon, and the petals begin to wither and fall by nighttime, even while underground or indoors. When a fresh pine needle is held while the string is pulled, the needle extends in length to accommodate the draw of the bow and when fired, deals as much damage as a regular arrow."
93,"A heavy mace whose masterfully crafted, lacquered head is fashioned to resemble the face of a woman. The soft, graceful curves of her lips and her deep understanding eyes, sooth any who look upon her beatific. Her angelic features change drastically in combat, her face twisting into an enraged snarl. Her opened mouth revealing a forked tongue and fangs that sink into her wielder's enemies on each strike."
94,"A spiked chain with seal-laden blades of steel connected by chain links, tethered to a handle made of solid, polished oak."
95,"A steel maul with a hollow haft with tribal inscriptions and designs. The hollow hafted part can be used as a didgeridoo that produces a low baritone sound."
96,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that sparkles brightly and looks incredibly ornate. When the weapon was forged, magic was used to infuse it with diamond dust. Consequently, it glimmers in the light and appears far more valuable than a normal weapon of its type. Extracting the diamond dust without powerful magic is (Sadly) impossible."
97,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that whenever its bearer is presented with an opportunity to act in a selfish or malevolent way, the object heightens the bearer's urge to do so."
98,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose maker's mark indicates that the weapon is the work of a legendary smith… when she was an apprentice. While functional, the weapon is not particularly special or exceptionally well crafted. It could still be valuable to historians or collectors, however."
99,"A sinewy hand crossbow made from the twisted bones of an ancient subterranean aberration."
100,"A pair of handaxes carved from the jawbones of a swamp dragon, one from the top, one from the bottom. The organically curving, supernaturally sharp blades were created through an expert combination of workmanship with blood sorcery woven into the weapons. Knowledgeable PC's will have heard of an group of warriors known as the Dragonmen who wield axes such as these, each weapon sanctified by a bone-eye (A blood sorcerer) and bathed in the blood of an innocent."
