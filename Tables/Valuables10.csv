The memories of any events will remain, but any emotional turmoil should be settled.

24,"Vaporizer: A spherical jar in the shape of a curled dragon that can hold up to one cup of liquid. The dragon's head serves as a threaded lid and its mouth gapes open as if to breathe fire. If any liquid is placed inside and the command “breath” is given, the liquid is slowly vaporized and “exhaled” through the open mouth until the receptacle is emptied.

If the receptacle is filled: Alcohol based liquids typically last a minute, while water based solutions last around eight hours and oil based liquids last around a full 24 hours. The vapor typically effects a radius of about 30 feet in still or calm wind conditions or if used indoors. The object is typically used as an air freshener with scented oils and for medicinal purposes with healing with oils of camphor, or other herbal extracts.

All four shoes must be worn at once, a partial set will offer no protection of any sort."
29,"A single acorn earring that when worn, allows the bearer to speak the language of the Fey, but only to say: “I don't actually speak Sylvan.

A riverseer plate warns of inanimate dangers within a 100-foot radius beyond the vessel in which it is set. Once per day, a creature can apply a drop of blood to a riverseer plate's surface.
