1,"A set of studded leather armor made from sharkskin, set with brass disks that don't tarnish."
2,"A set of unrelieved black armor fashioned from overlapping scales like that of a snake over a black gambeson and breeches. The scale mail includes a black cloak with a deep cowl whose flowing length never stirs in the wind."
3,"A suit of cord armor (Padded armor statistics) fashioned from tough hemp fibers, woven and knotted into a thick, resilient covering. The armor forms a complete suit, hampering movement but offering decent protection without the use of metal or leather. This type of apparel is common in places where metalworking and leatherworking are not practiced, such as among sailors who have rope and time in abundance or druids who may avoid the curing of animal hides for religious reasons."
4,"An ornate, highly polished suit of splint mail, whose rectangular steel strips are outlined with geometric patterns of rose gold wire."
5,"A battered shield that bears an insignia of a partially open door. All who look upon the image of the unshut archway it find oddly appealing. A sort of unspoken invitation to secrets beyond."
6,"A set of profane ring mail armor made of cursed, black iron and tainted demonhide, having been further desecrated with symbols of infernal power."
7,"An ornate set of scale mail constructed entirely of silvery, overlapping coins bound at holes in the centers, with a gorget and armguards. The interlinking metal disks are polished to such a shine that they reflect the faces of the people around the wielder like a mirror. The armor comes with a fearsome helmet with a faceplate capable of opening and closing."
8,"A set of leather armor fashioned from griffon hide. Tooled into the leather is a set of spiraling runes, forming the image of a falcon contained within a storm."
9,"A set of half plate consisting of iron sheets and leather treated with wax. A convex, angular, black and blue breastplate overlaps with a segmented apron and short thigh pads. The armor-plated brassards bristle with sharp, steel spikes. The visor, with its densely grated screen extends out in the shape of a dog's muzzle and is covered with spikes like a conker casing. The armor clatters and grinds whenever its bearer moves around."
10,"A beautifully crafted steel breastplate sized for a halfling or gnome, depicting seven mountaintops; the holy symbol of Yondalla, the halfling goddess."
11,"A breastplate fashioned from the chitinous exoskeleton of an extinct species of beetle. The beetle's mandibles jut out behind the wielder's shoulders like the hilts of swords, framing the wielder's head between the enormous spiked pincers."
12,"A dwarf sized wooden sizing mold with a doublet of padded armor on it."
13,"A wooden shield bound in human leather that's held in place with a rim of beaten copper. The skin is completely covered in a complex tattoo that appears to be some sort of map."
14,"A suit of plate armor which glistens as if it had been polished yesterday. The name of every warrior to ever don the armor has been inscribed upon the front and back of the chest plate, covering nearly every inch of its surface with precisely written, black runes. A careful inspection of the armor will reveal that there remains room for one last name."
15,"A dented but serviceable set of half plate, bearing an odd swirling design on the back plate."
16,"A set of ring mail fashioned to fit the torso of a human child but could also be worn by a gnome or halfling. The scratches and wear on the metal indicate that it's seen heavy use."
17,"A set of leather armor designed to be worn by a large dog or wolf. The leather barding is covered in a camouflage pattern of mottled greens, browns and blacks to aid the animal to blend into natural environments. —Note: If armor for animals doesn't have statistics in your game try using the following rules. A combat trained wolf or dog is considered trained in wearing barding, including any animal companion granted by a class feature or magic spell. A PC who transforms himself into a canine is considered proficient with the barding if they were proficient in leather armor as a human. It takes one minute for another creature to strap the canine into the armor or to remove it. The barding increases the canine's armor class or physical defenses as if he was as if he was properly wielding a shield (Typically a +2)."
18,"A large suit of imposing plate mail which has the face of Kord, the god of storms and the lord of battle, engraved on its front."
19,"A lightweight, oval shaped wicker shield, decorated with the image of a pair of intertwined snakes. The shield is as tall as an adult man and as wide as his shoulders."
20,"A chainmail shirt that protects the wielder's torso while leaving his limbs free and mobile. A layer of quilted fabric underneath it prevents chafing and cushions the impact of blows. Found alongside it is a good, rounded, steel cap."
21,"A suit of tightly woven reeds that when worn covers the entire body, offering slightly more protection than normal clothes. Knowledgeable PC's know this wicker armor (Padded armor statistics) is a poor solider's, militia member's or peasant fighter's last resort and while it does have the advantage of being cheap to make and maintain as well as being lightweight, it is bulky, loud and barely more protection than regular clothes."
22,"A set of leather armor whose breastplate and shoulder protectors are made of leather that has been stiffened by boiling in oil. The rest of the armor consists of softer, more flexible leather."
23,"An extremely large, circular convex war shield with tooled geometrical designs and half round hide handle on the obverse. The shield is made from hippopotamus leather and is more resistant to the wear and tear of rain and water damage than standard bovine leather."
24,"A set of leather armor that is light and flexible while still being able to ward off sword-blows. Crafted from rigid buffalo leather, the armor is strong enough to provide all the protection that a nimble wielder might encounter, while also light enough to let the wielder retain all the mobility and agility that he desires. The armor is a lamellar style breastplate, consisting of shoulder straps attached to lames, or wide leather bands, which are layered horizontally down the core to create a strong and solid defense. The edges of these leather bands are stylized with edged shapes and secured with riveted patterns, which not only enhances its strength and durability, but also infuses an element of style and flair into the armor, as well"
25,"A set of brigandine (Splint mail) constructed of a coat of leather plates, each plate consisting of leather with a strip of steel inside it. The armor's outer layer is a richly dyed velvet with gilded trim projects an impressive image and wouldn't be out of place worn by a high status individual in a lord's court."
26,"A set of studded leather armor made from tough but flexible leather (Not hardened leather as with normal leather armor) reinforced with close-set metal rivets."
27,"A sleeveless brigandine (Studded leather statistics) constructed from a garment of heavy canvas lined with small oblong steel plates riveted to the fabric. Unlike armor for the torso made from large plates, this brigandine is flexible, with a degree of movement between each of the overlapping plates. The rivet are grouped to produce a repeating decorative pattern and each rivet itself is stamped with said pattern."
28,"A set of armor made of interlocking steel rings. The chainmail includes a layer of quilted fabric underneath it to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. Several layers of mail are hung over vital areas. Most of the armor's weight hangs from the shoulders, making it uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. It includes matching gauntlets."
29,"A massive wooden tower shield that's nearly as tall as the wielder. A simply painted holy symbol belonging to the minor God of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ fills the entire face of the shield."
30,"A padded leather jacket (Scale mail statistics) covered in velvet and containing steel plates. The armored coat's long skit is split to the waist allowing the wielder to easily ride a horse. The jacket is elaborately decorated with gold lace, silk and satin, making it beautiful as well as practical. The suit includes matching vambraces and boots containing metal plates."
31,"A heavy set of brigandine (Ring mail statistics) comprised of a leather tunic strips of interwoven steel and hardened leather composing the exterior and pauldrons of pure enameled steel. The armor provides vambrances that cover the arms to the wrist and heavy but supple gloves. The brigandine is fashioned into a leather skirt and includes greaves and a matching helmet. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that this armor is common among career warriors and experienced soldiers and officers for the excellent protection it offers and it's low maintenance cost compared to similar forms of armor such as splint or plate. It is particularly favored due to the wielder being able to maintain a modicum of stealth while wearing it."
32,"A fossilized shield made from the horned skull of a great desert dinosaur. The jawbone is fixed to the rest of the skull with copper wire and the shield's grip is within the back of the armor's mouth not unlike a terrifying boney puppet."
33,"A full set of dwarven crafted, plate armor, made of interlocking stone slabs, cunningly carved for both thinness and strength. A layer of cured hide underneath the stone prevents chafing and cushions the impact of blows. Several layers of stone panels hang over vital areas, and most of the armor's weight hangs from the shoulders. The suit includes hide gauntlets with tiny stone plates sewn onto them. The armor contains no metallic components and is not considered metal armor."
34,"A suit of banded mail (Half plate statistics) made of overlapping strips of metal sewn to a backing of leather and chainmail. The strips cover vulnerable areas, while the chain and leather protect the joints and provide freedom of movement. Straps and buckles distribute the weight evenly over the wielder's body. It includes matching gauntlets."
35,"A suit of armor (Chain shirt statistics) carefully crafted by druids from the tough bark of ancient trees and treated to prevent it from becoming brittle over time. Strips of bark are layered together over a quilted sheet of cushioning animal felt. Protective bark is much more flexible than its metal counterparts but does not provide as much protection as most steel armor. The armor includes arm, leg, chest, and back protection, but it does not include gauntlets. The apparel contains no metallic components and is not considered metal armor."
36,"A ratty canvas coat reinforced with strips of bone cut from animals used for food. The studded leather armor was not well made to begin with and has seen better days. It does provide a modest amount of protection for the wielder's torso while leaving the limbs free for better mobility."
37,"A set of splint mail constructed from narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chainmail protects the joints. It includes matching gauntlets."
38,"A set of knight's armor consisting of a steel breastplate etched with a feathered pattern and trimmed with eagle feathers and worn over multiple layers of padding. The coif, which is decorated as an eagle's head, frames the knight's face with a beak-like visor. The protective leggings are fashioned with decorative talons. While worn, the breastplate armor causes the wielder to vaguely resemble some great wingless bird."
39,"A fine set of hide armor assembles from the pelts of several jaguars places over layers of padding. The coif, which is actually made from the skull of a jaguar, frames the wielder's face in the great cat's jaws."
40,"An exotic armor (Leather armor statistics) known as leafweave, which as the name suggests, is made from forest leaves which are then treated with a special alchemical process. The secret process renders the delicate leaves as tough and flexible as leather, with considerably less weight, encumbrance and loss of animal life. Knowledgeable PC's can assume that this type of apparel is common in places where metalworking and leatherworking are not practiced, such as among druids who may avoid the curing of animal hides for religious reasons."
41,"A suit of full plate consisting of shaped and fitted metal plates riveted and interlocked to cover the entire body. It includes matching gauntlets, heavy leather boots, and a visored helmet. The armor includes a thick layer of padding underneath it to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. Buckles and straps distribute the weight evenly over the wielder's body."
42,"A pungent buckler made from the fungus tinged, great toenail of a frost giant."
43,"A suit of leather armor made from dark snakeskin steeped in mysterious alchemical mixtures. This armor (Which knowledge PC's can identify as Nightscale) is much like mundane leather armor, except that it is much more supple and formfitting. Many martial sorcerers and war wizards favor this exotic armor."
44,"A collection of silk swathes that can serve as a form of exotic protection that it as dependable as leather armor. The sheer material is nothing more than elaborately wrapped cloth strips but is perfect for clothing in hot environments in addition to its martial defense. Air trapped between layers allows the skin to respire, while the material itself absorbs moisture readily and dries quickly. The wrapped layers are surprisingly effective against weapon blows. However, donning and doffing this armor is time-consuming and difficult, taking as long and following the same rules as for putting on or removing full plate. While wearing the armor, whenever the wielder would have to roll a saving throw or ability check to resist a negative effect caused by hot environments condition he adds +1 to the roll. This bonus is not usually applicable in combat scenarios as the +1 provided by the armor typically reflects a saving throw that is representing minutes to hours of time rather than a few seconds."
45,"A suit of half plate constructed from the shells of giant crabs. The ocean crustacean's chitin is heavily polished and the inner surfaces are fitted with padding, rendering it flexible and rather comfortable to wear. The armormaking process softens the shells, making them far more pliable and likely to bend instead of shatter when struck. The armor includes a pair of lobstered gauntlets fashioned from a pair of monstrous crab's pincer's making the wielder truly fearsome to look upon."
46,"A set of exotic hide armor that resembles a rubbery suit of thick leather, with long sweeping tentacles attached to the bottom. Knowledgeable PC's will conclude that the material was sourced from the severed tentacles of some huge aberrant monster. While clever, the armor is somewhat crude in design, as if the severed tentacle was simple hollowed out and three holes were added for a head and arms, with two smaller tentacles sewn onto the arm holes for sleeves. Despite the amateurish crafting process, the armor is supple and an effective deterrent against weapon blows."
47,"A simple yet effective leather breastplate (Leather armor) that provides basic protection with good mobility and even kidney protection. There are two hinged leather sections on each side that wrap around the wielder's body for additional defense. The armor is made from heavy brown leather and will withstand a surprising amount of abuse on behalf of its wielder."
48,"A highly polished, silver-etched breastplate. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize that the various etched symbols indicate the bearer has the military rank of a captain in the kingdom's standing army."
49,"An enormous suit of armor made of thick metal plates bolted and fused together causing the wielder to resemble a mountain of steel. While worn, the wielder is a juggernaut of virtually impregnable heavy plate armor that clanks, clatters and grinds whenever its bearer moves around. The exotic heavy armor is incredibly massive and the suit includes plated gauntlets, metal-shod boots, a heavy helm, and reinforced joint guards."
50,"A rusted set of half plate engraved with dwarven symbols of an anvil and thunderbolt."
51,"A set of steel scale mail displaying the knightly heraldry of a forked black lightning bolt on a field of red. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize the insignia as that or an order of inquisitors infamous for their sudden and unpredictable “investigations” which often leave death, destruction and the smell of smoke and charred flash in their wake."
52,"A fine steel, round shield that glows faintly blue when touched. When it is struck by any hard force it creates a small shower of bright, blue sparks."
53,"A vest of studded leather armor crafted from a single piece of hide of unknown origin. The studs consist of various bones and large teeth, all as black as a starless night. If left alone, the armor seems to shiver and undulate on its own when looked at from the corner of the eye"
54,"A set of scale mail crafted from copper coins with matching gauntlets. The sigil of the banker's guild has been stamped into the face of each and every coin. It doesn't look like it would hold up to blows from steel weapons and may be ceremonial or symbolic."
55,"A shield attached to the forearm of a locked gauntlet, all crafted of steel. The shield displays face of a lion, modeled in exquisite detail. The steel mane seems to flow in the wind, and lesser animals regard the toothy maw nervously. The wielder cannot be disarmed of the shield while worn, however it takes a free hand and an action equivalent to making an attack or casting a spell to don or remove the gauntlet."
56,"A steel breastplate that covers the wielder's front and back. The armor is found alongside a sturdy helmet and matching greaves that covers the wielder's lower legs. Under the breastplate lies a light suit of flexible leather that protects the wielder's limbs without restricting movement much."
57,"A sleeveless chainmail shirt inset with dozens of stripes of white and red jade, scattered throughout the steel rings. When the wielder moves, there is a rippling effect of scarlet and verdant hues as the polished stones catch the light."
58,"A sturdy set of half plate whose entire frontal chest piece is taken up by the image of a winged, radiant eye that stares unflinchingly out through the scars and gashes of innumerable battles."
59,"A set of scale mail fashioned from the alchemically strengthened scales of a giant, dire cobra. The serpent's massive hypodermics fangs serve as the armor's pauldrons."
60,"A chainmail shirt that covers the torso, decorated with dozens of tiny ivy leaves, forged of steel and lacquered a verdant green, woven amongst the metal rings. The chains themselves have been stained a dark brown, creating the appearance of armor made from healthy vines or rejuvenated wicker."
61,"A set of armor fashioned of rough, slate grey leather, studded with polished brass rivets. The armor's chest piece is emblazoned with a stylized black tower."
62,"A translucent, green-tinted breastplate that resembles thick glass in every way but its durability, which is somehow as resilient as typical armor."
63,"A perfectly smooth, octagonal shield made of starmetal that bears an animated iridescent galaxy design, that slowly moves and twinkles with celestial starlight."
64,"A full set of steel plate mail tinted a deep crimson and sporting a helm featuring a pair of horns, one of which is cracked in half. The armor is extremely conspicuous due to the massive, blood red, spiked metal shoulder plates."
65,"A soft, hairy suit of padded armor made entirely out of black, dire spider hairs, with four strange holes in the back. If the armor is worn during sleep, the wielder dreams of sitting next to the Spider Queen herself, who sheds praise and seductive wiles on the wielder. At the end of the dream the dark Goddess leans down for a kiss and the wielder wakes up as soon as their lips meet."
66,"A small, rounded steel buckler with a surface so smooth and polished it could be used as a mirror to shave with."
67,"A set of plate mail crafted from beautiful grey steel gilded with polished gold inlay. The armor gives a natural sense of comfort, safety and home to the wielder and any allies who sees it."
68,"A large asymmetrical set of hide armor consisting of tainted animal skins, grisly trophies and foul misshapen runes that are painful to look upon."
69,"A shield whose face is dark and reflective. Circles of pure white energy spread from its center whenever it deflects blows like ripples in a pond."
70,"A set of old-fashioned armor (Half plate statistics) with large, flat arm guards on each shoulder and a full-length mail hauberk slit down the front and rear for ease in riding. It is a colored a deep purple, almost black and is bound by bleached leather laces dyed lavender. The edges of the armor plates are gilded and in some areas decorated with gold traceries evoking the open plains."
71,"A strange suit of plate mail that seems to be made from an unidentifiable greenish rock, with various rock plates covered by strange runes. A multitude of stalagmite-like spikes of varying sizes protrude along the arms and shoulders."
72,"A dull breastplate, stained with blood and rust. The armor has a puncture in it, where the wielder's heart would be. The edges of the puncture are rough but they extend out of the breastplate as though it was punctured from the inside-out. The damage is disturbing in origin but not serious enough that the armor's quality of protection is hampered by it."
73,"A shining knight's plate mail that is a work of inspired artistry, every inch covered in intricate detailing, engravings and inlaid with finely worked silver. A shimmering cloak of blue, lined with soft fur, flutters behind the armor, held in place by a heavy golden brooch in the shape of a grail chalice. The armor is adorned with countless devotional tokens and sacred icons, from holy beads to miniature pendants carved from finger bones of saints into the likeness of holy symbols of Random Good Gods. The helmet is topped by a majestic unicorn of silver, surrounded by a host of candles on short spikes that when lit, cast a halo of light around the wielder's person."
74,"A ramshackle set of plate mail consisting of a misshapen collection of shields and breastplates, no doubt scavenged from the crafter's fallen foes. Layered overtop of the various metals lies a tunic of flayed skin sewn together from what appears to be at least dozens of said fallen foes."
75,"A baroque, suit of sculpted plate mail forged from ensorcelled gold. Tendrils of dark energy constantly caress the skin of the bearer, who occasionally hears faint whispering promises of perverse pleasures awaiting the proper host."
76,"A large rectangular tower shield made of seven layers of hardened leather, faced with a layer of steel that is embossed with the image of a seven pointed star."
77,"A chain shirt of exceptionally fine texture and quality. Black threads of spider silk appear to have been woven in among the metal rings."
78,"A shout shield covered in splotches of purple stains that upon close inspection smell like wine. The shield appears to have been made from the bottom of a large wine barrel and is a surprisingly decent piece of armor."
79,"A tower shield made entirely of ancient stone, perhaps from a slab from an archaic temple or long forgotten tomb. Adorned on the bulwark's front is a scowling, bearded face with leaves and roots for hair, challenging any would-be opponents to stand the test of time."
80,"A set of leaf-like scale mail with a pair of dull steel spaulders resting overtop. The armor plates over the shoulders have been artfully forged to resemble snarling wolf heads."
81,"A set of ring mail that appears to be made of jaguar hide reinforced with disks of polished black onyx, yet is far too lightweight for that to be the case. The armor seems to slowly draw in the light around it, noticeably dimming the area immediately surrounding it."
82,"A suit of imposing half plate armor. The breastplate has been forged from dark iron, as has the chainmail beneath. The right arm ends in a brutal gauntlet with thick spikes protruding from the knuckles. The helmet is also adorned with similar spikes, and a viewer gets the distinct impression that being struck by either would be most unpleasant."
83,"An unusual chainmail shirt, forged from thousands of interlocking azure steel rings. Further reinforcing the armor is a pair of black leather pauldrons, and a matching chest covering that tapers down to a series of flexible scales near the abdomen. The masterful craftsmanship of this piece combines the durability of metal with the suppleness of leather."
84,"A set of hide armor made from the pelts of wolfs. The armor is in decent condition that offers good protection. The aesthetic of the hood is made from a wolf's head."
85,"A dented and rented breastplate repaired with a bright and shiny gold leaving streaks of glimmering metal among the hard iron. The wound it depicts was a mortal one, a cleft down the shoulder to the navel; front and back. The armor is no weaker than any other, in fact it seems sturdier than other examples of its kind. Sometimes the wielder feels a stitch in his side running shoulder to navel, the kind of pain a toothache brings, with a gnawing pinching squeeze of pain, then instantly gone as quickly as it came."
86,"A suit of plate mail composed entirely of black plates, each joint and engraved line made to fit smoothly over its bearer's body. A skirt of black, oiled mail hangs from the waist, joined seamlessly to the armor as if a natural part of it. The neck is collared with steel that leads to a smooth, domed helmet topped with two spiraled black horns, like those of a dragon bent low."
87,"A set of hide armor that's supple as leather. The material looks like steel, sometimes blackened and sometimes silvery and Knowledgeable PC's will be able to identify it the skin of a gorgon."
88,"A full set of interlocking chain mail armor. It consists of a mail coif, leggings and a sleeved mail shirt worn over full leather padding."
89,"A ridged suit of half plate forged of blued steel, adorned with numerous spikes and decorations."
90,"A cheap suit of leather armor made of cow hide that no doubt belonged to a member of a nearby militia."
91,"A footman's light shield of kingly steel and poplar, decorated with five diagonal orange stripes on a black field."
92,"A heavy shield made of pebbled grey leather stretched on pine displaying an indigo banner reading “Faith Is the Wages of Terror” on a white field."
93,"A set of plate armor fashioned to make the wielder resemble a demon. The helmet resembles a horned demon head, and its wielder looks out of the open, fang filled mouth. The armored gauntlets have large wicked claws over each finger that look sharp enough to disembowel a man with a single swipe."
94,"A splendid, grooved, brass edged breastplate."
95,"A strange copper breastplate covered in verdigris and decorated with merfolk symbols that are mostly worn away."
96,"A set of ^RandomArmor^ stained a rich bright ^BrightColourTable^ with good quality dye that doesn't fade or wash out."
97,"A set of scale mail consisting of lacquered animal horn strung together in parallel rows using a fine cord. The suit contains a breastplate, greaves and a leggings."
98,"A set of leather lamellar consisting of thick rawhide pieces, lacquered and laced together to form a cuirass and skirt. It's more sturdy than normal leather armor (Studded leather statistics), but only just."
99,"A good leather breastplate (Breastplate statistics) made almost entirely from thick, heavy, brown, leather, providing a rugged, solid level of construction that will withstand rigorous use. The breastplate consists of several layers of leather plating that have been successively mounted overtop one another, creating a defensible and protective piece of armor in a simple style. The armor contains almost no metal components."
100,"A shield made by fastening together planks of pine wood, side by side then covering them with animal skin and affixing an iron boss into the center. The edge is rimmed with more hide and the shield is meant to be chewed up as a battle goes on. When an enemy strikes with an axe or sword, the weapon can be caught in the shield, then it only requires a simple twist to disarm the enemy. When an enemy makes a melee weapon attack that deals slashing or piercing damage against the wielder that misses, the player can use an action equivalent to an attack of opportunity (See Note) to block and catch the weapon with the shield. Once stuck in the layers of hide and soft wood, the wielder and the enemy immediately make opposed strength checks. If the wielder wins, the enemy is disarmed and the weapon flies 15 feet in a random direction. If the enemy wins, he is able to dislodge the weapon while retaining a grip on it. In either case, catching a weapon damages the shield's wood and leather construction and after catching five weapons (See Note:) the shield is considered broken and no longer provides adequate protection but can be fixed by those with the skills to do so. Fixing the shield requires proper tools (Leatherworking or woodcarving) and material resources equal to 20% of the total value of a typical shield for each time the shield has caught a weapon. In order to make use of the shield's disarming qualities the wielder must have practiced with it with a sparring partner for at least one hour in the past week. This practice can be done with a sheathed sword or blunted training weapon and therefore doesn't harm the shield's integrity. —Note: It can catch five weapons in total, whether the disarming is successful or not. On the fifth catch the weapon sticks, but when it is pulled free the shield is destroyed. If your system doesn't use attacks of opportunity use the following rule: Once the wielder attempt to catch a weapon with the shield, he is no longer able to do so until the start of his next turn."
