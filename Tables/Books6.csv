14,"Stone, Parchment, Fireball; Playing Fair Will Get You Killed: A witty and insightful text introduces an approach to using magic in more creative and impactful ways. The premise of the book is that entering every situation as if a magic-user could not use magic is the best way to determine how that magic-user should, in fact, use their magical abilities. The author provides many humorous and bewildering anecdotes regarding their travels and how this approach to using magic saved their lives on many occasions."
15,"Spell Components; Verbal, Somatic, and Material: A slim, yet exquisite tome that details the nature, sources, and uses of various materials and objects used in the casting of spells. In addition to this, the text also goes in to excruciating detail regarding how the components of spells and the methods of casting each spell was discovered. Instead of being a conventional book made of ink and paper meant to be read, a voice emanates from the book when opened that immediately begins to read the book in the voice of its author; the only way to navigate to a specific point in the book is to close it, reopen it, and start from the beginning until the listener reaches said specified point."
16,"The Book of Sand: A beige-covered book with no writings or markings on its cover. The book is written in an unknown language and is occasionally punctuated by odd illustrations.

17,"El Lastimador del Valle. A short work, made for enthusiast entertainment, detailing all known reports of the Lasher of the Valley, a drake-turned-serial killer once feared in the fertile winelands surrounding a nearby prosperous city. The Lasher, once thought to be a beast of singular, torturous wont, was known for leaving victims with great, streaking cuts. Not deep, but plentiful. Life-threatening, but not efficient in their dispatch. Victims reported being toyed with by a low and skulking monster which leapt from the vineyards. Only after its eventual slaying by a knight errant was the Lasher revealed. It was a wretched, determined thing. A dragon hatched with a queer deformity of its joints that prevented it killing quickly or crawling aright. Despite its mutant status, the Lasher was a beast of singular willpower: It took three dozen folk before its demise."
18,"Stephen Lich-King, An Un-Life in Print; The Autoboigraphy of Stephen Lich-King: A book is printed on fine paper and bound in green cloth, with a portrait of Mr. Lich-King on the back cover. Horror writer Stephen Lich-King has terrified generations (Many generations) with his particular brand of edge of your seat storytelling, ever since he first published Barrie, some 650 years ago. Over the years, his titles, such as Bujo, THAT, and the Teal Kilometer, have become household words, and Mr. Lich-King has become a recognized master of the horror genre. However, his latest book, his 5,140th, is perhaps his scariest work yet. It is a nonfiction account of his early life as a human, his dark apprenticeship in necromantic magics, his transition into lichdom, and the depravities which he has inflicted, and indeed, continues to inflict, upon all who have fallen into his clutches. It is a harrowing read, and in any other writer's hands, this material might have proven unworkable. It is a testament to Mr. Lich-King's skills as a writer that it did not, and, quite to the contrary, it is perhaps the most existentially frightening non-cursed tome in print today. Readers who crack open An Un-Life in Print will come away visibly pale and trembling, and will likely spend the next fortnight checking under their beds for Mr. Lich-King before they go to sleep. They are also likely to learn something about Necromancy, Lichdom, and the undead."

Includes, as an aside, several recipes beloved by spice traders."
23,"Forever, Clearly: A short and grim work on the lowly and concealed practice of cultural banishment. Though it may seem otherwise, folk are yet cast out from civilization, usually by small communities insulated from the world, and set to wander the wilderness for the rest of their days. A terrible fate, oft-culminated in starvation or gobbling by some monster. It is a punishment few recognize still exists, whether they know of its truth or not."

This specific volume is part of a regularly published series with multiple authors."
29,"The Deductive Treatises: A bound series of academic papers by Maxwellian Horacio whose treatises are, in higher scholarly circles, regarded as hogwash. The tome is composed of several broad topics, each of which covers an exciting and fantastical subject, such as dragons, fey, and giant landworms. They are useful only for their entertainment value, as the information within is complete supposition and armchair-philosophy."
30,"A Lawyer's Guide to Stealing Eldritch Power Volume 1: A small black book written by an individual with a blacked out name on how to permanently steal the power of warlock patrons. Part 1 explains the difference between patrons and how to set up a siphoning ritual. Some of the material requirements are the eyestring of a Tarrasque, the gallbladder of an elder dragon, and an aboleth fin. The last page states that all the words that will need to be spoken will be in volume 2. Said volume 2 is missing."
31,"The Gilder: A biography of the late Lance Veerchance Delavince Sevreaux, the Rue de Couture's most influential designer. Once a mere milliner's assistant, young Sevreaux drew notice for the complementary patterns he would attach inside hats sold to notable models and artistic influencers. Patterns for wardrobes of clean and cutting design, rife with silver, steel, and gold; at once more elegant and more inspired than anything else those days worn. At the notice of several wealthy patrons, Sevreaux was petitioned to enact some of these patterns, and by their success soon swelled in reputation to become the Coast's most haute clothier. Sevreaux's biography, while a tale of high success, is also a tragedy. The end of his life was marked by madness, distress, and eventual suicide by poison. He had for his whole career utilized a nitre of mercury in his hat-crafting and fire-gilding, a gnawing substance which slowly put insidious holes in his brilliant mind. His influence lives on, today."

33,"The Journals: A book of mythology pertaining to a series of burgundy journals with a golden hand (which has six fingers) with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Legend has it they contain advanced knowledge on many topics that commoners would find unusual, such as Cursed Doors, Gnomes, and Infinite-sided Dice. The books are never placed together, and are buried in the ground all over the world. Bringing the Journals together provides information on how to summon Bill Cypher, a pyramid shaped demon that has control over time and space and brings about the end of the universe by making it too bizarre for the laws of reality to be upheld. Knowledgeable PC's will have heard myths that the Library of Forbidden Knowledge contains the first journal."

43,"Arougal's Descent; This Being a True Account as Witnessed by Valis Arougal: A true account of the Archmage Demaris Arougal, who chose to contend with fiends for the right to a layer of Hell. Historical works either omit Arougal or paint him as a monster; this tome penned by Arougal's estranged niece portrays the wizard as an ultimately flawed but brilliant individual. ”Think not ye can wrest from Divvils a space in Hell and mak it with thems help a place of gud; that way has been follie.” - Excerpt, Arougal's Descent."
44,"The Arcane and Enigmatic Mystical Properties of the Far Realm and Those that Hail from It (The Aempfrathi for short): A technical work written by a surprisingly scholarly warlock known only as “The Pupil” that has devoted a lot of time killing, dissecting, and speaking with various aberrations.

58,"A collection of holy texts of a God who was murdered ages past. The final pages are a form of prophecy hinting at possible resurrection if her devoted followers assemble a list of powerful artifacts, willing sacrifices and dangerous rituals under the proper alignment of constellations.
