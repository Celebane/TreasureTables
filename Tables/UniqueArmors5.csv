1,"A set of chainmail decorated with a row of small metal disks, each stamped with a tankard symbol."
2,"A suit of ^RandomArmor^ armor decorated with remarkable imagery associated with the divine concept of ^GoodDomains^. The bearer feels a weak sense of devotion to that sacred ideal and feels slightly motivated to perform acts in its name or support those who follow it. The wielder is not compelled to act in this way and is not forced to violate any strongly held morals or beliefs. Whenever the wielder actively exemplifies or supports that Godly domain, the armor noticeably glows and the wielder experiences a euphoric high."
3,"A set of studded leather armor consisting of a black leather jerkin with silver steel pauldrons, black leather gauntlets with reinforced steel plates covering the knuckles and forearms."
4,A nearly indestructible kite shield fashioned from a single enormous scale of a sea serpent. The shield is a shimmering deep blue and catches the light like a cresting wave. A creature grasping the shield can feel and smell a calm ocean breeze and hear the faint cries of gulls in the distance.
5,"A darkly hued suit of ^RandomArmor^ armor. A particularly observant creature will notice that the shadows cast by the armor's wielder are of the wrong size and shape. They always seem too big, too black, and sometimes shift of their own accord or in opposition to the wielder's movements."
6,A stout wooden shield with an upraised iron horseshoe serving as the boss. Holding the shield causes the wielder to feel as if the odds are in their favour.
7,"A set of armor consisting of cloth woven with and placed over multiple layers of padding (Leather armor statistics). The coif, which is decorated as an eagle's head, frames the bearer's face with a beaklike visor. The tightly woven leggings are fashioned with decorative talons."
8,"A set of concealed armor that resembles a suit of regular clothes; a long sleeved shirt and trousers. Cunningly incorporated sections of padding and resistant cloth strips are woven into a protective shell around the wearer's body, without betraying their existence to the casual observer. While the suit only offers the same protection as padded armor, it is better than nothing and can be further enchanted if the bearer possesses the funds to do so."
9,"A suit of ^RandomArmor^ armor that is dyed a deep black with stars and other cosmic phenomena worked into the dark design."
10,"A halfling sized set of battered half-plate armor painted with brightly colored, many petaled flowers."

13,"A magnificent suit of scale mail armor crafted from solid gold, but it seems as solid as steel. The image of a peacock, its tail fanned prominently, is emblazoned on the breastplate."

17,"An elegant and lightweight suit of mithral elven chainmail, with platinum pauldrons, gauntlets and tassets shaped like overlapping leaves and a large platinum ironwood leaf, inlaid with gold, emblazoned in the centre of the chestpiece. It is treated as light armor."
18,A suit of ancient bronze half-plate. It is surprisingly well maintained and shows very little wear.

20,"A hide shirt with thin strips of bone lining the outside (Chain shirt statistics), making this armor both light and durable. Although it offers excellent protection compared to leather armor, it does not have the durability of comparable heavy metal armor. This armor may be worn by druids or those incapable of wearing metal armor without penalty."
21,"A medium sized suit of chainmail painted red, with black sleeves. A faint preservative aura surrounds it but is too weak to provide any actual protection."
22,"A suit of ^RandomArmor^ armor that while not in any other way inferior to others of its ilk, simply looks weak, puny and generally unimposing."
23,"A suit of padded armor of drab olive-green quilted cloth, trimmed with wolf fur."

39,"A suit of ornamental armor comprised of a gold-plated chain shirt from the deserts of Khemet, adorned with a beautiful collar of turquoise and gold.

86,"A poor man's suit of ^RandomArmor^ armor whose appearance is dubious at best. Any metal components are scratched dented and rusting while its leather is ratty, stained and rotting away. The armor is unpleasantly fragrant, smelling of mildew, refuse and unwashed bodies. Despite its appalling condition a close inspection reveals that the armor is sturdy enough to get the job done if someone has low enough standards to don it."
87,A heavy steel shield with a distinct curve to its shape and bears the device of a valiant knight.
88,"A chain shirt whose fine links form a pattern of roiling clouds. The steel is cold to the touch, always emanating a thin layer of mist that quickly dissipates."
89,"A suit of muddy brown hide armor that carries a fetid stench like raw sewage, and occasionally sprouts angry and uncomfortable-looking blisters. Knowledgeable PC's can determine that the armor was fashioned from the skin of an otyugh, a revolting aberration that living in and feeds on garbage.
