1,"A talisman depicting a forgotten deity from a bygone era. If you held to the ear, the bearer can hear faint murmurings."
2,"A rudimentary tripwire consisting of a length of thin string wrapped around two small sharpened, wooden stakes along with a length of tiny, ash-darkened, copper bells that can be wrapped around the tripwire. The trap can cover an area five feet in length."
3,"A one gallon keg curiously labelled “Mudder's Milk” on its lid. The keg is filled with a batch of stout beer so dark, dense and filling that it could pass for a soup in bad lighting. The beverage has all the proteins, vitamins and carbs of a full course of your grandmother's best turkey dinner plus 15% alcohol. The keg contains enough beer to serve as 2d4+1 days' worth of trail rations."
4,"A map of the local tavern, showing several levels of basement below it. The last three levels are crossed out and “don't go here” is written in pencil."
5,"A single black envelop upon which is a single silver glyph, lightly afire. You do not recognize the language, nor even the alphabet of the burning symbol. Regardless, while touching the mysterious inscription you are instinctively aware of its meaning, as if the words were branded with eldritch fire directly on the grey matter of your soft humanoid brain; “VACATION APPROVED”. You know in your mind exactly what it says. You wish you did not know. If you are able to ken the ancient eldritch script of the elder primordial beings from before recorded time, you are able to understand that the note was written by an unknown number of entities known as “Station Management”."
6,"A sheet of parchment with a black handprint and the words ""We Know” written underneath it."
7,"A lustrous black flask inlaid with a silver skull pattern. It is plugged with a skull-shaped stopper with reflective red eyes. To complete its menacing appearance, the eyes glow slightly in dim light. Knowledgeable PC's can determine that the viscous green fluid the flask contains is actually an antivenin for the treatment of giant spider bites."
8,"A clean steel sap spigot that can be rammed into a tree in order to allow it to pour forth the sap inside."
9,"A silver chain on which hangs a polished silver bell the size of a thimble. At one point in the bearer's life, the bell will ring three times, producing three bursts of silvery sound with a brief silence after each. The vibrations that shiver through the bearer's body will seem much too strong to have been produced by such a tiny clapper. This squared trio of ringing heralds that great danger will soon befall the bearer from which he is unlikely to survive."
10,"A painting of gnolls gambling with playing cards."
11,"A carved stone plate with horrifying pictographic symbols etched into it."
12,"An unremarkable silver coin whose faces sport two expressions. One face is joyfully exuberant, and the other is depressingly dour."
13,"A deck of playing cards that will always deal the worst possible hands to all players."
14,"A simple silver key with “Guest Room” etched finely on the handle."
15,"A pouch of very small bones that can be fitted together to form a strange, highly complex and obviously occult symbol."
16,"A small hourglass holding enough sand to mark the passage of one minute. The bases are made from obsidian flecked with gold and carved to resemble a long-fingered hand holding the hourglass at each end. The glass itself is made from fine crystal and the sand inside is red."
17,"A small dark rock (Two inches in diameter) that was naturally formed into the shape of a demonic creature with bat wings folded around its body. It is semi-translucent with a dark center that sometimes seems to move. Occasionally it seems to whisper. If one listens closely, the whisper can be understood, but it is a foul and evil entreaty to do some horrible act. A bearer who chooses to obey these instructions, never feel remorse or guilt during or after carrying out the horribly despicable and particularly sadistic actions. Should a bearer who performs evil deeds at the stone's bequest lose the rock or stops carrying it on his person, the awareness, guilt and shame of his evil deeds comes back to him all at once and he is thrown into deep despair."
18,"A silver hand mirror ornately engraved on both sides; one side bears a frowning mask, while the opposite bears a smiling one.  There doesn't appear to be an actual mirrored surface, despite its shape."
19,"A figurine made of twisted fragments of copper wire. It is in the shape of a bird-headed human and although it seems to be many hundreds of years old. Extremely knowledgeable PC's are able to determine that it is in fact a fake that has been aged to appear antique. Nevertheless, it will still fool anybody who is not an expert on the art of the period. Its metal value is only a handful of copper but it can be sold for a good deal more to the right (i.e. uninformed) buyer."
20,"A walking stick, shod with silver and with the head of an eagle as its handle. The eagle's head once had two garnets for eyes but these have long since become mislaid. If the head is grasped firmly and unscrewed, it will reveal a long but thin container which can be used to store liquor."
21,"A bulbous flask of opaque white glass filled with a slightly syrupy fluid that's a deep, warm golden color, almost metallic looking."
22,"A mask bearing a dread visage crafted of wrought iron and set, is perpetually set with a sneering saturnine face."
23,"A pair of goggles with hexagonal mineral lenses of a sharp yellow hue, secured in bronze frames, with a black leather strap that feels slightly scaly and slimy. They give off a faint odor of rotten eggs if sniffed directly."
24,"A dagger sized scabbard containing strips of natural sea sponges on its interior. By carefully pouring a dose of poison into the empty scabbard (An action equivalent to attacking), the bearer can saturate the sponges with the toxin, which keeps it viable and wet for up to four hours. When a dagger is drawn from the sheath, it is automatically envenomed as if the liquid was applied directly. The bearer can also pour holy water or flammable oil into the sheath but acids will destroy the sponges. This kind of item is usually illegal in areas that outlaw poison."
25,"A large mummified paw of long dead beast. Dried blood stains the fur around the petrified claws which are still razor sharp."
26,"A deep violet sash made of silk adorned with gold embroidery of imps and succubi dancing with each other."
27,"A small metallic whistle with a single blowhole. The pipe is divided into a number of twisted and interlocking tubes, with many holes for the air to exit. This strange configuration produces a cacophonous mess of simultaneous sounds when blown."
28,"A matching shaker set of celestial salt and abyssal pepper."
29,"A hooded lantern that is painted rather intricately with a house cat motif depicting cats playing in different poses. It's mostly painted in whites and pinks, and it has small scuff marks on one side."

31,"A dark leather and silk monstrous mask with jet eyes."
32,"A jangling bracelet of tiny golden bells and fine-toothed cogs on crimson silk rope. It is suited to a small wrist interested in intricate mechanisms."
33,"A glass jar containing a heart that continues to beat."
34,"A plain-looking wooden bowl of water, which remains unnaturally still while inside it. Looking at one's reflection in the water shows an idealized version of oneself, in accordance to the viewer's ideals. Perhaps by lowering one's head into the bowl for long enough, one can gain insight into how to become the self seen in the bowl."
35,"A silver oak leaf cloak clasp, edged and highlighted with gold."
36,"An ancient drinking horn crafted from some extinct beast. Those who drink from it have dreams of being a huge predator roaming unchallenged through a prehistoric landscape."
37,"A detailed sketch of a cross section of a brain, with a long foreign object being inserted through the front. Labelled fig 2: proper extraction positioning."
38,"A bunch of scrapped papers that, if unfolded, reveal badly written poems describing the writer's deep love for a womanly shaped rock existing in a nearby forest."
39,"A heavy copper belt buckle resembling an axe head."
40,"A wistful portrait of a singular dark mountain on a broad plain, trees covering the top third of it and nowhere else, far higher than trees ever normally grow on a mountain. The middle of the mountain sports two large overhangs of rock above deep depressions, not quite caves. A stream flows down the bottom third of the mountain, splitting its flow around an overhang that shelters a massive cavern entrance that goes who knows how deep."
41,"An aged obsidian fruit knife with bronze handle."
42,"A piece of exotic wood, carved to look like a quill, with a gold tip. Its purpose is obviously ceremonial and no doubt used for signing important decrees or documents, as it is awkward to write with."
43,"A silver and brass mirror with lewd designs hidden around the frame."
44,"A gilded oil lamp with ornate scrollwork cutouts of a warrior, and an evil sorcerer, meant to cast shadows on the wall in their shape."
45,"A blood red mask made from carefully sculpted bone, shaped to look like the face of a grinning demon."
46,"A fist sized piece of jagged garnet. The deep crimson and maroon gemstone pulses faintly and smells of blood."
47,"A lyre crafted from wood from the vale of shadows that emits a slight ringing at all times and a subtle glow of green when it is played."
48,"A leather pouch containing dozens of petrified raven's claws with the talons splayed outwards. If scattered across an area the stony claws function as caltrops in every respect."
49,"An old copper door knocker fashioned to resemble the face of an eldritch creature. It is always cold to the touch."
50,"A two-foot-long wooden rod bearing a silver wolf's-head at the tip, and its length is inscribed with moon-sigils."
51,"A small, masterfully crafted toy carriage made of stained black walnut complete with leather driver's seat and interior upholstered in crushed velvet. Anyone who stops to admire the detail of the model in detail has the urge to break one of the wheels, first starting as a fleeting thought but gradually grows to consume their thoughts causing insomnia the longer they resist the urge. The wheel is instantly repaired any time the toy goes unnoticed."
52,"A crimson monkey skull weighing four pounds, carved entirely from blood garnet. An aura of feral sentience draws your gaze to its empty eye sockets."
53,"A rolled scroll on which was hastily scribbled hymn, full of zeal. It says that it is only in rapturous frenzy that the spirit exhibits grace. At this moment, we are freed from doubt, acting only in accordance with the divine, immaculate will."
54,"An ornate token from an opulent land. When held, one feels aided by forces paid for dearly. Surely, no cost is too high for triumph?"
55,"An inflamed gland that's little more than an engorged, muscular lump, radiating heat. The repellent hunk of flesh pulses with a warm, wet heat like an exhaled breath. The gland's presence consumes the senses. One's head begins to ache with a feverish intensity the longer it is held."
56,"A scalpel with a wide blade, etched with a diagram of a human body on each side. One side features a chart of the circulatory system, and the other a layout of the muscles and tendons."

59,"A jawbone from a mammalian beast, a handspan in length with dozens of tiny needle-like teeth arranged like a pincushion"
60,"A surprisingly light, cobalt blue, metal cube the length of a hand. The many holes on its surface appear to resemble stars in the night sky."
61,"A small sea chest, locked securely. The key is probably somewhere close by. Inside are a dozen glass bottles containing extremely rare and valuable spices. Unfortunately, they are so old as to be unfit for any purpose, and only identifiable by their labels."
62,"A small, cork-stoppered crystal bottle with a disproportionately low and fat belly and slender neck containing a ruby colored liquid with an overwhelming odor of citrus. Tasting the liquid brings forth visions of standing atop a pyramid in a desert land, overlooking a sprawling city on a broad river flanked by irrigated farms."
63,"A thumb-sized bronze horned owl. When the head is turned clockwise three full rotations, it flaps its wings and makes hooting noises as the head rotates back."
64,"A soapstone dragon turtle paperweight with a tiny flag on its back that blows in whatever direction the wind is currently blowing in outdoors."

70,"A pottery vase decorated with images of a foot race."
71,"A glass eye with an azurite iris and obsidian pupil."
72,"A one gallon cask of Seabeast Poison, an alcoholic beverage found mostly in coastal taverns. This mixture is almost black with a white, frothy foam on top. It's said the original recipe included venom from the poison sacs of a rare sea creature. The exact creature varies from tale to tale and the modern recipe surely doesn't include this venom…. Right?"
73,"An engraved geode that has been split apart into two equal halves. A labyrinth is carved into the rock's rough exterior and glows with a faint light."
74,"A beautiful deck of cards resting in a strong leather pouch with an etching of a joker on the outside. The same etching is on the back of the cards."
75,"A strange wand that is visually translucent, but when held closely, one can hear the sound of a light spring rain."
76,"A glass figurine of a unicorn with a chalcedony horn."
77,"A pair of pearl earrings held in eagle claw settings."
78,"A humorous ensorcelled cartoon strip about Cernuous Cedric the slug-about-town, a languorous libertine known for his lechery, taste for strong drink, and allergy to any form of labor. The strip speaks and animates when read, telling the story of one of Cedric's disastrous affairs with the husband of Mordiggia, the Charnel Goddess."

80,"An ancient hieroglyphic tablet made out of some type of reflective metal that can float in water and makes a strange echoing hollow sound when struck."

85,"A copper serving pot edged and highlighted with silver depicting the labors of a famous hero."
86,"A hardy wine bottle that is completely opaque and holds a strong, deep red, fruity alcohol."
87,"A simple leather pouch that has several charred humanoid bones in it and a small dusting of ashes. There is no smell of smoke though, so they must be quite old."
88,"A pure white face mask with pewter trim around its edges. It is sculpted into what could be called a bird head with an unusually short beak, also covered in pewter, but with delicate filigree."
89,"A large blue banner decorated with a flaring yellow crest and mounted on the end of a ten foot brass pole. It is meant to be the standard used to keep the morale of the troops high as its valiantly held aloft."
90,"A large ceramic jar covered in silver leaf."
91,"A brass candelabra etched with filigree pattern."
92,"A bar of rough soap made from ground pumice, and a little bit goes a long way. Light gray in color, it scrubs off trail dust, sweat, and blood with equal ease, leaving behind a clean, slightly dusty scent."
93,"A tiny dead sparrow, wrapped delicately in giant green leaves."
94,"A four inch long, plain, pocket pen carved from giant's tooth enamel, tipped with a gold-vanadium nib, and silver cap."
95,"An item that appears at first glance to be no more than a simple burlap doll with no hair or clothes in the shape of humanoid. The doll's wicked grin and black sapphire eyes tell keen observers a different tale."
96,"A heavy brass torc ending in clenched fists."
97,"A copper door knocker of a celestial with twin amber eyes."
98,"A tin bucket without a label, filled with what appears to be loose teeth. A closer look confirms the contents: dozens of molars, bicuspids, incisors, canines. Human teeth. Enough to fill at least five or six mouths. Resting on top of the pile is a rusted pair of iron pliers."
99,"A swirly mahogany wand that changes to a different color every night at midnight."
100,"Innocent Lockpicks: A set of nondescript masterwork thieves' tools coated in a matte black lacquer, that seems brittle enough to break. They are favored by spies and thieves that cannot afford to be caught with the tools of their trade. As an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, the bearer can break the brittle coating of the tools, causing them to dissolve into a puff of smoke, destroying the evidence of any wrongdoing. Because of their fragile nature these tools have a chance of breaking. If the bearer rolls a natural 1 while using the tools, there is a 25% chance that the tools snaps and dissolves in his hands. The item's properties are wholly mundane and do not register as magical."
