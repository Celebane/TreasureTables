1,"Chillrend: A longsword bearing a leaf shaped blade of sharp blue ice which is freezing to the touch. Its iron handle is permanently frosted over and most creatures require gloves in order to wield the weapon without suffering frostbite. While drawn, the blade emanates a vapor as if it were experiencing sublimation, and constantly produces a hissing noise, similar to dry ice mixing with water. When used in combat, the wielder's hands become coated in a fine layer of frost (Which deals no damage and melts normally) and half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered cold damage while the rest is normal for its type."
2,"Drown: A steel trident decorated with bronze barnacles along the upper part of its haft, Drown has a sea-green jewel just below the tines and a silver shell at the end of its haft. It floats on the surface if dropped onto water, and it floats in place if it is released underwater. The trident is always cool to the touch, and it is immune to any damage due to exposure to water. Drown contains a spark of Olhydra, the archomental Princess of Evil Water and the tiny fragment of her essence influences the bearer to become covetous and greedy. A long term bearer may discover his personality changing, finding that he is more likely demand and feeling deserving of the largest share of the spoils, and refuse to part with anything that's his. The bearer is aware that using the trident against others may grant him more gold to add to his horde and that causing pain and injury to others is worth it if the end result is more gold in his pocket. The bearer is never forced to act on these feelings but so long as he carries the weapon he may be swayed by its avarice. When the wielder lands a critical hit, instead of producing blood, ichor, tree sap, sloughs of undead flesh or other similar substance, the target shreds pure gold droplets. The equivalent of one gold coin per point of hit point damage dealt by the critical hit (In total, to a maximum limit of the amount of hit points the target has remaining), tumbles out of the target's body and falls to the ground. —Note: DM's can change the effect to function on the first time per day the wielder lands a critical hit if they feel their players will get distracted trying to abuse the effect to get rich rather than treating it as a fun, novel weapon."
3,"Rhindon: A kingly longsword with a pommel shaped like a golden lion's head and a red grip bisected by a gold ring. The sword has a silver blade with gold words engraved on both sides. One side reads: “When Aslan bares his teeth, winter meets its death.” while the other side states: ""When He Shakes His Mane, We Shall Have Spring Again.”. The weapon is extraordinarily durable and any wielder can plainly feel the solid construction under its unyielding form. The weapon is five times harder to damage than a typical longsword and never breaks, chips or dulls as a result of casual use and is all but impossible to break or damage as a result of combat, even when targeted by enemies who attempt sundering or weapon breaking techniques. The weapon and its sheath of matching design are immune to rust, age and mundane wear and tear. The weapon is treated as a +1 against wolves, dire-wolves, were-wolves and other canine creatures."
4,"Plague Bringer: A thick club made entirely out of wood so rotten its species is unidentifiable. It's covered in various colors of toxic mold and riddled with small holes made by crawling insects that burrow into the club and constantly skitter from hole to hole. The only patch of untainted wood on the entire weapon is the grip, which is tinted white and has symbol of a horse and a swarm of flies etched onto it. Small chunks of toxic mold, rotten wood and dead insects routinely fall off of the weapon leaving a trail of refuse in the wielder's wake. The mold on the club seems to regrow over the lost material and the burrowing insects will bring up fragments of rotted wood from the club's center to replace bits that have been lost. No matter how much of the club's material falls off, it never seems to get any lighter and never loses its structural integrity. Creatures in possession of the weapon feel mildly sick most of the time and occasionally feel as though the burrowing insects were crawling over their skin even when they aren't touching the club. Despite how he feels the bearer becomes objectively hale and hearty, seemingly at the expense of those around him. Or perhaps the club treats the bearer as some kind of symbiote using him to ferry the weapon to its next victim. All creatures with ten feet of the weapon (Excluding the bearer) suffer disadvantage on saving throws against disease, infection and sickness and the bearer gains advantage on those saves. A successful hit against a living creature introduces toxic splinters, black mold and burrowing maggots directly into the victim's flesh hampering their body's ability to heal. Whenever a living creature damaged by the weapon would be healed (By any source, power or ability whatsoever), roll the amount healed twice and use the lower result. Should the creature instead be healed for a non-rolled amount of hit points, reduce the healing by one point to a minimum of zero. The magical toxins are short lived and the reduced healing effect only lasts until the start of the wielder's next turn."
5,"Last Whisper: A shortbow made of pale gold wood with gold accents, surrounded by a faint bluish haze. Built into the arrow rest lies a pair of large curving fangs of an unknown animal, arrows are fired from between the teeth. Carved into the wood along the interior of the shaft is the phrase “You May Say Your Last Words, With A Whisper"". The weapon becomes completely invisible when it is in the possession of a creature who is being forced to whisper. The weapon makes no noise of any sort when it strikes a target and negates any sound the target would make as a result of being hit. Even if the wielder took the weapon into both hands and struck a gong as hard as they could, the result would only be silence. A creature struck by the weapon cannot utter any sounds louder than a barely audible whisper until the start of the wielder's next turn. While the weapon is being wielded and for one hour afterwards, the bearer cannot speak louder than a barely audible whisper. This does not hinder spellcasting (Unless the spell requires the target to hear the bearer) as the bearer is still able to speak but he cannot provide rallying cries to allies, give instructions, shout for help, or yell warnings. The forced whispering hinders the bearer's ability to properly project their personality and they suffer disadvantage on all charisma based checks that rely on them speaking. —Note: In game terms only creatures within five feet of the bearer or victim can hear them whispering in optimal conditions. During loud situations such as combat, thunderstorms or in a loud taverns, whispers cannot be heard at all."
6,"Cudgel of the Interrogator: A bloodstained and heavily worn club whose magic is activated whenever it strikes an intelligent creature. The wielder can either choose to deal normal club damage with the weapon or deal a single point of nonlethal damage which renders the victim unconscious but alive whenever it would normally kill. A creature struck by the Cudgel can only speak the truth during their next sentence. The struck creature is incapable of speaking if the words they consider or know to be untrue. However, the struck creature can make any statement they wish such as “I hope you die!”, “The sky is blue.” or “My name is X.” Being repeatedly struck with the Cudgel forces the creature to speak the truth again but it can be the same truth they said the last time. Victims will often repeat the same insult, state their name or simply state the color of a nearby wall or other incredibly obvious fact to get around the cudgel's magic."
7,"Bystander's Bullets: A grey bandolier containing 20 ornate sling bullets. Each piece of ammunition consists of a sealed glass orb filled with black and white liquids in a yin-yang design which are kept separate by a thick layer of glass. A knowledgeable PC can identify the liquids as holy and unholy water, essentially the distilled essence of good and evil separated by simple glass. The bullets can be launched from a sling normally, the projectiles are unnaturally attracted to neutral creatures changing course slightly to hit them. The glass shattering on impact splashing the target with both liquids. The holy and unholy water mix together finding a mutual enemy in those who have refused or refrained from taking a moral side. An intelligent neutral creature (A creature who is not overly good or evil, regardless if they are lawful or chaotic) is damaged by the mixture of holy and unholy water even if they would not normally be hurt by either of them. The holy water burns the target with white fire, putting off billowing clouds of pure steam, while the unholy water melts the target with black acid putting off trails of thick acrid smoke which curl downward. The sling bullets are considered +1 ammunition if the intelligent target is neutral, chaotic neutral, or lawful neutral. To all others the explosion of shards upon impact of the glass bullet along with the coating of noxious profane liquid and sterilizing sacred water deals as much damage as a mundane sling. —Note: In games with no strict alignment or moral code, the DM has final say on what creatures are valid targets. In such games, the bullets automatically impart to its wielder which creatures within 30 feet are moral bystanders (Valid targets) so the ammunition is not wasted."
8,"The Coward's Way: An ornate, gem studded, dueling rapier that is so gaudy it is nearly ceremonial in appearance. A proficient wielder will notice that despite its flamboyant appearance it is a functional lethal weapon with a few deadly secrets. This rapier was designed and enchanted for cheating in lethal duels by unscrupulous contestants. Pressing a small gem near the base of the grip causes the pommel to spring open revealing a hollow hilt that can fit two small darts. Twice per day, the wielder can press a different gem-button to magically propel a dart from disguised hole next to the base of the blade at a target within 15 feet. The attack and damage rolls are treated as though the wielder had thrown a dart that he was proficient in. This can be done once per round as part of making an attack with the rapier without penalty to either attack. Alternatively, the wielder can spend an action equivalent to an attack to aim and fire the dart (The wielder often levels the blade at the target during this time taunting them or saying “En garde!” to disguise the aiming action) which grants advantage on the attack roll. The rapier makes no sound when launching a projectile and the dart is rendered invisible for one minute after the being fired, making it nearly impossible for witnesses to notice that the wielder has cheated the duel. The sheer number of superfluous gems decorating the weapon make finding the gem-buttons by chance nearly impossible, even for an experienced dueling judge to discover during a routine weapon examination. The rapier is protected by minor shielding wards and when held or carried by a living creature it does not give off a magical aura and is not detectable as a magical object."
9,"Dragonglass Blade: A large sharp chunk of knapped obsidian with a leather strap wrapped around a dull section creating a hilt. Upon casual inspection it seems to be a crude stone knife, however perceptive PC's will notice a finely etched symbol of a dragon seated on a throne made of swords, which is mostly hidden under the leather. The dagger is considered a +1 weapon against undead creatures and beings consisting primarily of ice or snow. Obsidian is quite fragile however and whenever the wielder rolls a natural 1 on a hit with this weapon, they must roll an additional 1d4. If the roll is another natural 1, roll damage as normal and the weapon shatters, dealing half of the damage to the wielder as well as the target."
10,"Nightmare Lash: A smooth, jet black whip whose long sinuous cord that moves slightly of its own accord, curling into nightmarish shapes whenever it's seen out of the corner of one's eye. The whip flays the target's mind as well as their skin with each strike and half of the damage dealt by it is considered psychic damage while the rest is normal for its type. Whenever a being touches or is struck by the whip, that creature relives a fleeting instant of a long forgotten childhood nightmare, before the memory quickly submerges back into their subconscious. Twice per day, when the wielder lands a successful attack against an enemy he can choose to cause that creature to suffer from severe night terrors during their next eight hours (Consecutive or nonconsecutive) of sleep as they experience a vivid and specific Random Nightmare. The victim's sleep is plagued with thrashing and screaming as they frequently bolt awake terrified, drenched in cold sweat, their heart pounding heavily in their chest. The creature's sleep is so disturbed by the nightmares that they gain no benefits from the rest whatsoever."
11,"Hammered Drunk: A durable, travel sized, green steel tankard with the image of a warhammer etched upon it. Any alcoholic beverage drunk directly from the container tastes as though it is of a much better quality than it actually is. A creature holding the tankard can concentrate while touching it against another piece of iron or steel (Taking an action equivalent to drawing a weapon) to cause the cup to instantly transform into a full-sized warhammer. The weapon shows signs of obvious craftsmanship and the symbol of a master weaponsmith is etched on the warhammer's grip, marking it as a rare and valuable piece. The warhammer's damage dice increases by one step (See Note) to the next largest die. To return it to its original tankard state, the wielder must whisper “That'll do.” to the warhammer in Dwarven. —Note: For example, if a normal warhammer deals 1d8 damage wielded in one hand and 1d10 in two hands, Hammered Drunk deals 1d10 and 1d12 respectively."
12,Briar's Blight: A cold iron bastard sword that appears to have been grown rather than forged. The flanges of its elaborate hilt and elegant blade are set with strange stones glistening in shades deeper than emerald and blooming with growths of finest silver. The sharp blade glows with warm firelight equivalent to a candle when it's within 100 feet of a fey creature and the weapon is treated as a +1 against them. Fey creatures are never considered proficient with the weapon and may injure themselves wielding the cold iron and silver hilt.
13,"Moonblade: An elegant longsword of elven design proudly displaying an antique moonstone hilt. When the weapon is used in combat, the wielder experiences the faintest of spiritual connections to all those who have previously wielded the blade in battle. Elves in particular benefit greatly from this, as the longsword was forged and primarily owned by elves over its centuries of existence and elven wielders treat the weapon as a +1 due to the guidance of their ancestors spirits."
14,"Wyrmslayer: A bastard sword of elvish make, with a silver inlaid hilt and a pommel set with a light green stone. The crossguard is straight with a slight flare at each end and the weapon sports a fluted grip that can be wielded in two hands or one. The blade will begin to buzz aggressively if brought within one mile of a dragon. The buzzing will grow louder if the sword is brought closer and the sound itself is not only quite irritating and bothersome to a woken dragon but it is capable of waking a sleeping dragon as well. The weapon is treated as a +1 against dragons and other reptilian creatures that are predominantly covered in scales."
15,"Stormblade: A Dwarven longsword with a hilt wrought of gold with silver chasings and inset to the handle are four sapphires as well as one in the pommel, all perfectly round and smooth. The blade is a fine steel with a streak of glowing red that runs up the center which no darkness can diminish. The weapon is a masterwork of Dwarven craftsmanship and knowledgeable PCs will recognize it as Stormblade which was originally forged for the Thane of the Hylar. The weapon can never be marred, harmed or broken in any way, including through the use of magic and Stormblade is treated as a +1 when wielded by a dwarf."
16,"Fighter's Flaming Flamberge: A specially crafted greatsword with a wavy blade, resembling a tongue of flame in shape. When parrying, the undulating sword creates unpleasant vibrations which can be transmitted into the attacker's weapon, allowing a wielder to potentially block melee attacks made against him that he is aware of. Using an action equivalent to an attack of opportunity (See Note) the wielder may attempt to parry an incoming melee attack, increasing his armor class or physical defensiveness as if he was properly wielding a shield. The wielder may benefit from the armor class bonus (Typically a +2) even if he is already wielding a shield. The sinuous blade's resemblance to fire is furthered by the magical enchantment on it causing the metal to look like an oversized dancing candle flame. The illusionary fire glows slightly and responds movement causing the sword's flame to flicker and dance with each swing. The semblance of fire is backed by truly scorching heat and half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered fire damage while the rest is normal for its type. The wielder must have practiced with the sword for at least one hour in the past week in order to remain accustomed to the vibrations and be considered proficient with it. —Note: If you're system doesn't use attacks of opportunity or interrupting actions use the following rule: Once the wielder parries an attack he is no longer able to do so until the start of his next turn."
17,"Celestial Fury: A katana of immaculate craftsmanship, the blade is extremely flexible, yet completely unbreakable and remains constantly honed to razor sharpness. Its hilt was wrapped in leather, granting it a comfortable grip adorned with a magnificently large pearl. Ancient characters for “Celestial Fury” are inscribed on the blade, which glow a pale violet hue and snap with electricity. The sheathe is made from the hide of a gray dragon and occasionally flash in hues of silver, blue and violet. The weapon's channels the fickle nature of the heavens within its blade and directs lethal jolts of power directly into the target's body, shocking the delicate nervous system and leaving smoking, flash burned skin. Half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered lighting damage while the rest is normal for its type."
18,"Revenge: A finely honed dirk (Dagger statistics) made of hammered cold iron that always feel chill to the touch. The easily concealable, double edged, thrusting weapon lacks a crossguard and bears the phrase “Best Served Cold” in raised letters along the grip. The weapon deals numbing injuring leaving the victim covered in their own slushy blood, frozen in shock over being attacked. Half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered cold damage while the rest is normal for its type. There is not an ounce of material or decoration on the dirk that is strictly necessary and its combat size cause the bearer to gain advantage on any checks made to conceal the weapon on his person."
19,"Frost Giant Fork: A massive utensil (Trident statistics.) that comes from the table of a frost giant. Latent jotun magic flows through this makeshift trident and drives the wielder's hunger to nearly aggressive levels. Once per round on his turn, when an attuned wielder successfully lands an attack with the fork he can immediately spend half of his total movement for the round to lunge at the target and attempt to bite him. The wielder's jaws and teeth become fortified to have the strength and density of the weapon's original owner, allowing this follow-up bite attack to deal damage equivalent to a dagger and protecting the wielder from injury. To attune to the trident, the bearer must touch the tip of their tongue to one the weapon's tines. For the next 48 hours after attunement, the bearer's hunger becomes almost insatiable and he needs to eat three times the normal amount every day, or risk starvation penalties. The wielder can renew the attunement at any time."
20,"Hallowed Courage: A wondrous and divine warhammer, forged and blessed by the great celestials above, upon the Anvil of Planes. Upon its great head are impossibly intricate etchings and depictions of the valiant doings of various archangels, and it constantly gleams with a sacred radiance. The grip of the hammer is comforted with beatific, angelic fabrics, and the handle is covered in supernal runs of sacrosanct power. The will of the gods forged into physical form, it is a beacon of hope in the darkness. When wielded, the weapon glows a comforting golden light equivalent to a candle and allied creatures within ten feet gain advantage on all rolls made to resist fear effects."
21,"Wavebreaker: A gleaming Greatsword made from the finest sea gold, found in the darkest depths of the sea and honed by crashing waves. The blade is set with a hilt of ^RandomColour^ coral, decorated with iridescent fish scales that ends with a large pearl that serves as the pommel. The sword strikes with the unstoppable power of the sea itself when its recently tasted the brine of its birth. Whenever the weapon is completely submerged in saltwater, it is treated as a +1 for the next hour."
22,"Stonecrusher: A great blunt maul with an iron beast-head at its tip, the weapon is a symbol of the eternal desire to unmake that which man has made and cast down his civilization so that no stone is left standing upon another. The weapon is treated as a +1 against animated creatures, artificial constructs and objects of any kind."
23,"The Baton of Whispers: A curious club hewn from dark hickory, it is twisted and tough, the wood is knotted near the base and at the end, and is roughly three and a half-feet long. Enemies hit by the baton are afflicted by horrible visions and whispers of dark truths they cannot comprehend and half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered psychic damage while the rest is normal for its type. The horrific sensations plague the victim, hampering their ability to determine reality from illusion. Creatures damaged by the club have disadvantage to perception checks based on vision or hearing until the start of the wielder's next turn. Those who brandish the baton themselves are not safe from its effects, however. While the club is on their person, the bearer can hear the light sound of voices in the back of their mind. The voices are of men, women, and children alike and they whisper taunts that wear away at one's insecurities, secrets the bearer thought nobody could know, and sometimes just gibberish. Typically, they can be shut out and ignored, but they provide enough distraction to impose disadvantage on all hearing based perception checks the wielder makes while the weapon is being wielded and for one hour afterwards."
24,"Hellblade: A jagged, iron ^RandomSword^ whose blackened blade glows with heinous enchantments. Knowledgeable PC's are familiar with tales of Hellblades and it is said that they are razor-edged and honed on the souls of those who have fallen in battle to the malevolent Blood God's demonic soldiers. When held, the wielder's mind is filled with dark thoughts of cruelty, senseless violence and causing harm to innocents and the weapon itself radiates a palpable aura of ruthlessness and evil intentions. The weapon bears abyssal glyphs that forcibly draw from the wielder's mental and physical defenses, worsening his ability to protect himself from harm. The weapon is treated as a +1 but while the weapon is being wielded and for one hour afterwards, the bearer suffers a penalty of -1 on all of his saving throws. It is unknown if the sword was truly sharpened by using a tortured soul but the blade is incredibly keen and whenever the player roll a 1 on a die to calculate the weapon's damage (See Note), they can reroll the die until they receives a result that is not a 1. The malicious nature of the sword creates extreme discomfort in those pure and middling of heart and non-evil creatures are never considered proficient with the weapon. —Note: This only affects the weapon's damage die itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects."
25,"Bow of the Conqueror: An ornate, pristinely white longbow with gold gilding and the symbol of a horse and a crown etched onto its grip. Creatures in possession of the weapon feel urges to conquer and be victorious over others. The weapon rewards those who spread the message of their dominion over others and if the weapon is used to land a killing blow on an intelligent creature while being witnessed by at least three other non-allied, intelligent creatures, the weapon glows slightly and functions as a +1 for the next eight hours for that wielder only. Whenever the weapon is treated as a +1, a large golden crown appears atop the wielder's head. It is a convincing illusion and shines with golden light that's as bright as a torch. The eight hour timer is reset each time the wielder meets the enchantment's requirements."
26,"The Sword of Change: A weapon rumored to have been wrought within the magical balestorm of the northern Chaos Gate, fashioned by the chaos demon Amon, whose fossilized eye is still grasped in the weapon's pommel. The Sword of Change is saturated with wild magic and even the air around the blade is in flux\: at one moment, the blade is wreathed with the scent of sweet perfumes reminiscent of a brothel, only to be replaced a heartbeat later with the stench of rot and decay of a fetid swamp. An eye-blink later and the air around the weapon shines with cheery multi colored hues before being surrounded in a haze of misted blood. The weapon's form is malleable and a wielder who concentrates on the weapon change its form into another type of blade at random (Roll a Random Sword) by spending an action equivalent to attacking or casting a spell. The eldritch weapon has the power to burn, freeze, electrocute, melt, cleanse, taint or even damage the very mind of those whose flesh it pierces. The sword's method of lethality changes with every strike and each time the weapon hits, the player rolls 1d10 and half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered that damage type (See Note) while the rest is normal for its type. —Note: The following list for the damage types. To save time I recommend the player rolls the damage type d10 at the same time as the damage to speed the process along: 1 = Fire, 2 = Cold, 3 = Acid, 4 = Lighting, 5 = Psychic, 6 = Thunder, 7 = Force, 8 = Poison, 9 = Necrotic, 10 = Radiant."
27,"Yolo's Greataxe: A heavily chipped and notched greataxe made of plain iron. The name “Yolo” is carved sloppily into the haft. The weapon still retains a portion of the tenaciousness and unbridled savagery of its former owner. While wielded, the wielder can disregard their own safety to attack with wild abandon. When the wielder makes their first attack on their turn, they can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so grants the wielder advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls made with this weapon during the turn, but all attack rolls against the wielder have advantage until the start of the wielder's next turn. Knowledgeable PC's will have heard legends of a powerful gnome mercenary who would hurtle himself into combat screaming his own name, heedless of the danger. Much of his history has been lost to time but the name remains, and it is not uncommon to see warriors invoke his blessing as they rush into battle by screaming “Yolo!” at the top of their lungs."
28,"Manreaper: A rusted, sawtoothed scythe that was dipped into the profane filth seeping from the throne of the God of Plagues. The shaft is carved of rot-wood, harvested from the swamp of the God of Plagues with a slimy grip covered in black mold that rubs offs on the wielder's hands before instantly regenerating. A living creature damaged by the weapon is immediately infected with a virulent fungal spores which hamper the body's ability to recuperate. Whenever a living creature damaged by the weapon would be healed (By any source, power or ability whatsoever), roll the amount healed twice and use the lower result. Should the creature instead be healed for a non-rolled amount of hit points, reduce the healing by one to a minimum of zero. The unholy toxins are short lived and the effect only lasts until the start of the wielder's next turn."
29,"Beginner's Luck: A longsword that looks unremarkable but feels uncomfortable in the hand of any creature wielding it. It may feel too heavy, too light, too unbalanced, pinch the wielder's hand or have some other issue that prevents it from feeling right. Whatever the problem is, it does not feel like an effective fighting weapon and the wielder always suffers disadvantage on attack rolls with it. If a creature is foolish enough to actually use in combat, the wielder finds that the longsword always critically hits on a natural 1 in addition to its regular critical range. Knowledgeable PC's will know that legend has it that the weapon was created by a long forgotten artificer who gave it away as a prank. It has been passed around between novice swordsman for centuries as a practical joke, each new recipient being told it was a powerful magic weapon that would reveal its secrets with use."
30,"Toro: A flail consisting of a heavy bamboo shaft attached to a thick brass chain, ending in an ornately carved, six sided, stone lantern with jade and amber motifs. Although well carved, the granite lantern is not actually strictly functional and lacks a receptacle for oil or a candle. When wielded however, the bearer can choose to cause the lantern to alight through sheer force of will. The wielder can spent a moment in concentration to cause the lantern to shine with the brightness of a candle in whatever color the wielder wishes. If the bearer requires more illumination they can choose to funnel a minuscule portion of their own life energy into the weapon (Dealing one point of damage to the wielder.), causing the lantern to shine as brightly as a torch in a color the wielder wishes. In either case, the weapon stops emitting light if the wielder releases it, or after one hour's time, though the wielder can snuff the light simply by thinking it."
31,"Titan's Toothpick: A wickedly sharp bamboo toothpick that was seems to have be made for giants. These towering behemoths often feed by tossing entire animals into their putrid maw and chewing and swallowing the entrails, bones and fur along with the meat. Giants are not well known for their delicate woodworking skills and it is likely this tool was made by a much smaller race. In the hands of a human sized creature, this oral hygiene tool functions perfectly as a six-foot bamboo longspear that smells strongly of mint (A perceptive PC will notice that the weapon's hollow interior is stuffed with packets of dried mint). This giant toothpick was made to resist a giant's firm teeth and fleshy gums while rooting out offending material, but was not meant to be a reusable weapon. When the wielder successfully strikes a target with this weapon, the attack is automatically considered a critical hit and the player is able to reroll all 1's and 2's when determining the damage roll. As part of the attack, the brittle spear explodes in a spray of splinters and ground mint, which deals damage to the wielder equivalent to a dagger and destroys the weapon. Knowledgeable PC's will remember a legend regarding a small village who attempted to foster better relationships with giants by creating these toothpicks in an attempt to reduce the rates of frustrated rampages by giants riddled with pain from infected teeth. According to the stories, the giants appreciated the ability to dig sheep hides out of their teeth after eating an entire heard of livestock and afterwards only rarely flattened that village. —Note: This only affects the weapon's damage itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects."
32,"Bo Staff: A six-foot-long quarterstaff made of tapered rattan wood that is thicker in the center than at the ends. The weapon sports a hexagonal cross-section and is reinforced with metal bands around the natural handholds, both of which render is easy to grasp and hold during combat, granting the wielder advantage to any checks made to resist being disarmed of it. The airy symbol of three wavy lines are painted along the length of the staff in beautiful flowing calligraphy. When held, the weapon hums in a deep, centering tone that is barely audible, yet strangely compelling to concentrate on and use as a meditative focus. A wielder feels connected to his inner self and at any time, can assume a relaxed position and enter a meditative trance. In this state the wielder turns his inner eye to his spiritual self and becomes unaware of his surroundings. The wielder is aware of how long he's been meditating for and can instantly rouse himself from the trance becoming fully awake at any time. He is automatically roused from the trance if he takes any sort of damage, is physically moved, his name is spoken within earshot or if he is no longer touching the weapon. Time spent in this meditative state fulfills the same purpose as sleeping for an equivalent amount of time (Making eight hours of broken up meditation over the course of a 24 hour period equivalent to a full night's sleep) but they must meditate in at least 30 minute increments to gain the benefit. The staff must match itself to its bearer's specific energy flows and a creature must meditate using the weapon for a period of four consecutive hours before they can benefit from the meditative sleep. The staff can only be attuned to one creature at a time. Knowledgeable PC's will know that this staff and its magical enchantment was originally developed by an order of monks to grant their warriors a meditation aid should the traumatic memories of combat (Typically desperate acts of self-defense against bandits and thieves) disrupt their ability to concentrate on calming their spirits. To their great disappointment, when the enchantment was shared with the world in an attempt to foster peace, serenity and self-reflection it was used mostly by armies (Especially mercenary companies) to allow their soldiers to sleep at will in a seated position. These armies were able to do away with bedrolls, tents, camping gear and other items of comfort and sleep, turning the army into a large band of quickly moving, nomadic raiders that never had to stay in any location for more than an hour or two and didn't have to entrench or defend a sleeping camp. The monks have since cut ties to those they shared their magic with, retreated to their secluded monasteries and grown disillusioned with the nobility of the human soul."
33,"Sword of Frost and Flame: A ^RandomSword^ whose cutting edge appears to be entirely made of a leashed ice storm and a caged bonfire, both bound within the rough confines of where the blade should be. The elemental magics are constantly fighting to overtake the over, the opposing energies producing explosive power that burns and freezes anything the weapon contacts. The sword has no physical blade whatsoever as it relies on its magic to kill anything that it strikes. Half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered fire damage while the rest is cold damage, it deals no mundane damage at all."
34,"Forewarning Flail: A well-crafted knight's flail with the symbol of a ^RandomCreatureTypes^ etched into its grip. The weapon contains a constantly evolving protective enchantment in order to protect its current wielder from whatever threat killed its previous wielder. This enchantment serves as a warning beacon to its bearer that enemies are nearby and that the wielder should prepare themselves for battle. The flail begins to glow with the intensity of a candle when a creature of the symbol's type is within 200 feet of the weapon. If a creature of that type is within 100 feet of the weapon it shines as bright as a torch. When a creature is within 50 feet of the flail, it emits a shrill whistling noise in additional to the bright light. The bearer is able to suppress or resume any of these effects with a thought. Should the wielder ever be killed, the symbol on the weapon automatically changes itself to the creature type of the entity that killed him. This provides a two in one benefit of recognizing a lethal threat and changing to protect against it in the future and denying that creature the benefit of using the flail's warning magics as it would just be constantly going off. —Note: The DM can assign one color for both lights or two different colors to better differentiate between them such as yellow within 200 feet and red within 100 feet."
35,"Brightstrike: A military issue heavy crossbow, covered with a dark mottled camouflage design and bears the symbol of a shooting star is etched into its grip. The weapon includes 10 modified bolts that are essentially climbing pitons turned ammunition (It can fire typical bolts as well) that can be launched by Brightstrike with enough force to bury itself into a brick or stone wall. These modified bolts are not able to support enough weight to climb with but are difficult to pull out especially when embedded higher than chest height. When a bolt is fired from the crossbow, the wielder is able to cause it to emit light that's as dim as a dull glow to as bright as a fresh torch, with nothing more than a mental command. The wielder chooses the color of the light and can choose to have the projectile emit light the moment the ammunition is launched, halfway to the target or immediately upon impact (Hit or miss). The bolt emits light for up to one minute, until the wielder mentally dismisses it or until a second projectile is enchanted with light. The wielder can choose to fire ammunition without enchanting them and can enchant up to two pieces of ammunition per hour. Knowledgeable PC's will have heard or military and mercenary strike teams who have used versions of this weapon as opener when dealing with small bands of enemies in dark conditions. Typically Brightstrike's wielder will bury a bolt in a wall or tree 6-8 feet off of the ground in the center of a cluster of poorly lit, unsuspected targets. The moment the bolt shines it's bright white light on the surprised targets, a half dozen other bowmen start taking easy shots at the well lit targets. By the time the victims have found their weapons and located the direction of the attack, they have suffered through several volleys of missiles. Attempts to cover or removed the embedded piton-bolt simply results in the creature being shot in the back for their trouble or a second illuminating bolt burying itself in the same area as the first. Typical enemies tend to scatter allowing the wielder and his allies to divide and conquer numerically superior foes or for the wielder to simply retreat after inflicting a few casualties and disrupting their rest."
36,"Caput Mortuum: A grim, somber-looking scythe with a haft of wood charred so badly that it resembles little more than charcoal. The blade is made of a lusterless gray metal and is wholly unadorned, except for a lone glyph engraved on each side, a circle with three small dots arranged in a “V” shape. The glyph glows a soft red whenever undead are within 100 feet of the wielder. When actively being wielded, the wood of the haft crumbles but the weapon's durability is unaffected. When the wielder uses the scythe to reap a life of a living intelligent creature, it steals a fraction of the victim's soul to create an indentured servant. The enslaved creature is an invisible, mindless and shapeless mass that can perform simple tasks at the wielder's mental command and functions as a loyal attendant. The being can exert up to 30 pounds of force and can perform simple tasks (It cannot attack) that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once given a command, the spirit performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for its next command. The unseen servant remains in existence for up to 24 hours, until it moves more than 60 feet away from the caster or until it takes any damage, at which point the being dissipates and the soul fragment is released to its afterlife to rejoin the rest of itself. The wielder can have up to a maximum of three unseen attendants at a time and must have the scythe on his person to command the servants to carry out a task."
37,"Serial Peacemaker: A hefty club fashioned out of a thick olive branch. Despite the obviously brutal possibilities of the weapon, it has a surprisingly benign appearance and radiates a small aura of calmness and rational thinking. The bearer feels a sense of encouragement from the wood's nature to foster peace, nonviolence and cooperation among anyone that they come across. If the wielder and his allies have genuinely attempted to negotiate in good faith (See Note) to avoid violence and bloodshed, the olive branch is appalled that their opponents have broken the truce and the weapon functions as a +1 for the entire combat encounter. The club stops providing a magical benefit if the wielder harms a creature who is unconscious, has surrendered or is otherwise no longer a threat and never provides a magical benefit to that wielder again. —Note: Negotiating in good faith can be as simple as quickly yelling “Throw down your weapons and you won't be harmed!” (An actually meaning it) or as involved as hours of involved peace talks. This takes at least one round of dedicated communication and nonviolence (Typically before combat begins) from the wielder or one of his allies, usually including a diplomacy type roll. The roll doesn't have to be successful as the club recognizes that its wielder has made the attempt."
38,"Touch-and-Go: A flamboyant rapier with a long, sleek blade and ornate hilt. The wire wrapped guard protects the wielder's hand and a weighted silver ball on the bottom of the hilt serves as decoration and a functional counterweight to the blade. Unlike than most blades, the rapier is decidedly a thrusting weapon, relying on the wielder's quick reflexes and fancy footwork to land a point and step away to safety. The rapier has been empowered to augment the bearer's natural grace and allows even a clumsy oaf to wield the weapon with a certain panache that almost looks like a gymnastic performance. The bearer is able to strike a creature and easily step away from the wounded foe before the enemy can even consider repaying the favor. When the wielder attacks a creature with the rapier, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against the wielder for the rest of the turn."
39,"Hell Root: A mace made from twisted, spiky brambles that were grown in grave soil, fertilized with cremated remains and watered with blood. A sickly looking fruit grows in a central cage and once ripe it will burst on the next hit spraying its acidic juices over the target. The fruit ripens by absorbing large amounts of fresh blood and instantly ripens whenever the wielder successfully lands a critical hit on a living creature. After a critical hit, on next successful attack with the mace, the player can roll all of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add the result to the damage dealt by the critical hit, with the additional damage considered acid damage. After bursting over the target, a single seed remains within the bramble waiting to be fertilized with fresh blood, repeating the cycle."
40,"Caustic Talon: A scimitar made entirely from rare, enchanted ironwood and blessed by a fey spirit in the form of a forest dragon. The fey creature's personal style manifested itself on the weapon and the blade retains the grain of the ironwood, its dark grey and deep brown streaks are now lined with brilliant streams of emerald acid that slither between the grain of the wood. Deep green dragon scales run along the spine of the blade, turning into leaves as they meet the hilt. The vine-wrapped handle spirals down to the dragon-headed pommel, its face locked in a fierce snarl. When the weapon is swung, the acid in the blade can be heard sizzling in anticipation of landing a hit, but the caustic liquid never spills its power in waste. Half of the damage dealt by the scimitar is considered acid damage while the rest is normal for its type."
41,"Denn'bok: A simple piece of black oak one-foot in length with a large green crystal seamlessly embedded into the wood. An extremely knowledgeable PC with recognize this object as the legendary weapons of a secret order of guardians commonly known as the Rangers who dedicated their lives to protecting the lands and the people who lived in them. Much of the sect's history is shrouded in myth and legend with even the very name of the group causing heavy debate. What most historians can agree on is that the group operated out of places called “White Stars” (Whether those are dungeons, secrets hideouts or even ships, is unknown) and that “The One” was an important part of their beliefs or structure. It is unknown whether “The One” is a God, the group's founder, the current leader or some sort of prophet. What is known is that the warriors needed a weapon that could be easily hidden and could disable rather than kill. A creature holding the object can take an action equivalent to drawing a weapon to think the command word (Which is “Anla-shok”, the sect's name for themselves) which causes the wood to instantly extend to the length of a standard quarterstaff. The quarterstaff retracts instantly if the wielder wills it or it ceases to be held. It can be extended and retracted as much as desired and it is said the warriors even created their own fighting style around extending and retracting the weapon during combat to confuse and distract their enemies. The quarterstaff extends so quickly that it is almost as though is magically appears in the wielder's grasp often surprising his foes. The first time per combat that the wielder extends the staff as part of making an attack with it, he gains advantage on the attack roll. The wielder must practice this unusual technique for at least one hour per week in order to make use of the weapon as an element of surprise. While retracted and carried by a living creature the weapon does not register as magical for the purposes of detection spells. While the Denn'bok is extended the wielder (And only the wielder) is able to read a fine script that goes along the length of the staff: “We are the Rangers. We walk in the dark places no others will enter. We stand on the bridge, and no one may pass. We engage in battle, we do not retreat. We live for the One, we die for the One.”"
42,"Craftmaster: A warhammer that is a strangely intricate blending of weapon and tool. The item seems to be a weapon in size and weight but its general appearance bears far more resemblance to a blacksmith's, forging hammer. The holy symbol of the God of Warfare is stamped into the entirety of the hammer's face. A bearer can feel a sense of bloodlust from the weapon as well as a sense of camaraderie and appreciation and respect for all tools of war, no matter their humble beginnings. The warhammer possesses a Random Masterwork Weapon Bonus and once per day when the wielder defeats an opponent in armed combat while using the weapon, he may direct the implement to change form, causing it to gaining a new Random Masterwork Weapon Bonus while losing the benefit of the old one. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this hammer as one of many from the God of Warfare's own forge where he works tirelessly to create marvelously lethal implements of battle. The deity takes pride in the skill, strategy and preparation of war, not just the killing and the warhammer's wielder can grant a divine blessing in the God's name. Once per day the wielder can touch the warhammer to a single nonmagical weapon (Or up to ten pieces of matching throwing weapons or ammunition) to bestow it with the skill of a master craftsman. The blessed weapon physically changes, gaining a Random Masterwork Weapon Bonus and prominently displays the God's holy symbol along its length. There can only be one such other weapon empowered at once and should a wielder bless a second weapon, the first weapon returns to its previous mundane form. The warhammer recognizes the skill of certain bearers and provides far more favorable results to those training in the creation of tools of battle. If the wielder is proficient in a skill that can create weapons such as blacksmith's tools, fletching, bowmaking or woodworking tools and has personally made at least one weapon in his lifetime, whenever the wielder would roll randomly to determine a masterwork bonus that the warhammer gains or bestows, the player instead chooses the specific result from the table instead of rolling. —Note: A DM who is using the Masterwork Bonus list on this blog should make sure to go through it first and make the PC aware ahead of time of any choices that he would not be allowed to choose for balance reasons. The warhammer is found with the following Masterwork Weapon Bonus = ^MasterworkWeaponBonuses^"
43,"Khopesh of the Sands: A traditional looking kopesh (Scimitar statistics) with a hilt made of human bone wrapped in sandy bandages. The weapon's grip bears the holy symbol of a Sun God primarily worshiped in desert communities; an ankh within a blazing sun. Knowledgeable PC's will know that weapons like these were created by the archpriests and master embalmers of the desert lands who prepared their dead in mummification rituals so that they could be resurrected by their God at a later time. Unfortunately the pyramids and burial sites of their deceased loved ones were routinely desecrated by necromancers who raised the preserved corpses as undead abominations, thus rendering that soul incapable of ever properly returning to its mortal form. An armory of these magically enchanted weapons were fashioned to repel the undead creations and guard the graves against future necromancers. The rage of the archpriests and embalmers burned long and cold and after they had created enough weapons to arm their own citizens, they began selling them abroad at cost, to ensure that all countries within any of their trade routes could stamp out those would defile the dead and raise them up. When used in combat, the wielder's hands are coated in a mixture of dust and desert sand and the weapon is treated as a +1 against undead creatures and any creature who has raised, created or commanded an undead creature in the past week. Undead creatures and those who has ever raised, created or commanded an undead being feel a horrific sense of revulsion when they touch the weapon and can never wield it proficiently."
44,"Greatclub of Exterminating: A large heavily worn greatclub bearing the symbol of booted foot crushing a beetle etched on its grip. Several more symbols are dotted along its length, all of which consist of a trio of smaller swarming creatures such as insects, vermin or birds and a number of notches carved under the image. The bearer's instinctual fears of the creeping crawling vermin and small but ferocious beasts are dampened while the weapon is in hand and the wielder feels as though he is orders of magnitude stronger than those smaller than him. While in combat, the wielder tends to puff himself up making himself look larger and more intimidating as he swings the greatclub in fierce overhead blows, bringing it down hard on him enemies as if trying to pummel them into the ground. The weapon is treated as a +1 if the wielder is attacking a creature at least one size category smaller than himself. The greatclub is also treated as a +1 against swarms of creatures (Such as spiders, rats or ravens) no matter the size of the swarm itself, as long as each individual creature in the swarm is at least one size category smaller than the wielder. Whenever the wielder kills a swarm of small creatures, the weapon magically adds another notch to itself near the corresponding cluster of vermin shaped symbols. —Note: If your system doesn't use size categories, treat the weapon as a +1 if the target is half the wielder's height or smaller."
45,"Flametongue: A handsome longsword with a blade wreathed in semi-illusionary flame and a ruby set in its pommel. The weapon's name, “Flametongue,” is etched in its fuller in an ancient, forgotten language. The sword's fiery power deal burning injuries that scorch the skin and leave charred, smoldering corpses in the wielder's wake. Half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered fire damage while the rest is normal for its type."
46,"Ashandarei: A long, black-hafted spear (Glaive statistics) with a foot-long, slightly curved, single-edged sword blade in place of a spear point. The blade is adorned with two ravens, and the shaft has an inscription written Sylvan, the ancient language of the Fey. The inscription translated reads: “Thus is our treaty written; thus is agreement made. Thought is the arrow of time; memory never fades. What was asked is given. The price is paid.“ The wielder experiences an odd sensation as if a set of dice were tumbling around in his head. The dice roll constantly, as if waiting for the right moment and only stop for a moment when the wielder attacks with the weapon. An insightful wielder understands that gambling and combat are one and the same and that every time battle commences it is time to toss the dice. The weapon's magic rewards a wielder who gambles with his coin as much as his life and provides a bit of consistency in battle if the wielder has participated in games of chance or skill and won or lost at least 10 gold pieces per character level through bets or wagers in the past 24 hours. Should the wielder meet this requirement, the player is able to roll 2d10's to hit when attacking with the weapon rather than the typical 1d20. The roll is considered a natural 1 or a critical fumble if both dice roll 1's, whereas a natural 20 or a critical hit occurs when the rolled dice added up to that result. Additionally, if the wielder has gambled the required amount in the past 24 hours, once per round when a creature enters the Ashandarei's reach, the wielder may make an attack of opportunity against them. —Note: “Gambling” can be anything from betting on horse racing, playing dice or cards to just making a 10 gp per level wager on the result of a single coin flip. To minimize abuse I recommend against betting gold with a fellow PC who might forgive a loss or forget to collect a winning. A DM might rule that the gold must be won or lost to NPC's unless the PC's are good roleplayers and don't take advantage of the mechanic. If you are not using a d20 system (Rolling multiple d6's or d10'd for example), or you don't want to use the benefit for balance purposes, you can instead treat this as a +1 weapon if the wielder meets the requirement."
47,"Noble Effort: A longsword that is perhaps the most cliché looking excuse for a magical weapon anyone has ever seen. The slightly glowing, seemingly silver blade neither emits enough illumination to be useful nor is actually plated in silver and perceptive PC's will discover its just a minor illusion disguising otherwise plain steel. The base of the blade and the hilt sports etching of arcane and mystical symbols designed to evoke mystery and instill onlookers with the possibilities of power and might. Knowledgeable PC's can tell that the symbols are meaningless doodles except for a few arcane runes that aren't activated and do not function together making them worse than useless. The entire weapon hums with power, a feature that cannot be suppressed causing it to be annoying to hold or store properly in a sheath, as the hum is due the the sword constantly vibrating rather than the purr of true power. In its defense the longsword is a true magic weapon and is a boon in combat but unlike the majority of magic weapons, its enchantment is laughably simple, not in its design (Which is actually standard for its benefits) but in its execution. Typical magic weapons subtly guide their bearer's attacks, causing them to strike truer and hit harder and the most of the time the wielder is not actively aware of the arcane help. In comparison, the longsword forcefully directs the wielder's attacks towards centers of the target's mass, exposed limbs or other dependable striking locations that are statistically more reliable to damage. The wielder can actively feel the longsword attempting to go its own way into order to strike a foe in a “safe” area that can be dependably hit. While this imposes no penalty on actually wielding the weapon, it makes it impossible to purposely, or even accidentally land a lucky blow in a vital area. The longsword is treated as a +1 but whenever the weapon would score a critical hit against an enemy, the critical hit is negated and the attack is considered a successful but non-critical attack instead for all purposes. Knowledgeable PC's will deduce that this weapon was likely enchanted by an apprentice artificer who has clearly grasped the basics of how to provide the benefits of a magical weapon, without quite working out the kinks involved with the enchanting process. The apprentice was much more focused on making the longsword “look magical” rather than making it actually functional."
48,"Hunter's Machete: A heavily worn machete (Shortsword statistics) which imparts its wielder with the direction and distance of the largest wild animal or beast within a one mile radius and the weapon is treated as a +1 weapon against that creature. Knowledgeable PC's will know that items like these are a kind of status symbol for big game hunters and large scale poachers who use them to seek their prey. There are stories of wielders taking weapons like these deep into the wild and hunting for days on end. The hunter then stalks the creature the weapon leads him to, kills it and immediately moving on to the machete's next target, leaving a swath of huge beastly corpses in his wake. This can be a rite of passage to some barbarian tribes, entrance into a guild or organization or even just away of expelling pent up rage. The machete also serves a practical survival tool for clearing brush and branches."
49,"Vampire's Kiss: A gruesome longbow whose string is made of human sinew and bow stave is made of pitch black ebony, stained bright red at both ends. The inner bend of the bow is lined with vampire eye teeth causing the wielder to seem as if they are about to be swallowed by a huge fanged mouth. The wielder's bare hands must touch the weapon for it to function, which causes their hands to become pale and bloodless like that of a corpse. In order to even bend the bow to fire it, the wielder must attune to it by pricking himself with the tip of one of the fangs and consuming the resulting drop of tainted blood. The wielder's body absorbs the vampiric energy and sends it pulsing through his bloodstream, granting him the ability to steal life from others but poisoning his body's ability to heal on its own. When an attuned wielder attacks and damages a living creature, the wielder is healed two hit points per character level to a maximum of the total damage dealt by the attack (See Note), as the attack leeches the vitality straight from the victim's blood. When this occurs, a burst of bright crimson mist appears from the wound and quickly follows the arrow's return path back the wielder and enters his body, leaving a red wispy trail that fades after a moment. This unnatural boon is not without cost though as the entire time a creature is attuned, whenever he would regain hit points from any source other than the weapon, he is only healed for half (Rounded down, minimum zero) of the actual amount. Attunement to the longbow can be renewed at any time (And can be attuned to multiple creatures at once) and wears off naturally after 24 hours when the bearer's system clears itself of the vampire venom. The attunement can also be broken with any spell or ability that is able to break or dispel curses. —Note: A combat example: A 10th level wielder who attacks a peasant with 5 remaining hit points and deals 12 damage. The wielder is healed 5 hit points but could have regained as much as 24 hit points if the target had 24 hit points remaining."
50,"Hunger of the Swarm: A blowgun made from the femur bone of a human that was eaten alive by locusts while he lay dying of starvation. The bone are still covered in the teeth and claw marks of the voracious insects. The bone is blackened and has symbol of a horse and a pair of scales etched onto its grip. A creature grasping the object has feel a desperate, unending, hunger from within the weapon. A pain that can be fed but can never be truly sated. After 24 hours in the bearer's possession, his face becomes drawn and emaciated and he must consume twice the normal amount of food and water in order to not suffer exhaustion penalties. When a creature is hit by the weapon it siphons off their energy and physical reserves and the target's body reacts as if they had gone and additional 1d4+1 hours without food or water. This effect is cumulative with itself and can cause fights lasting under a minute to end in the enemy starving to death rather than dying of his injuries. If the blowgun is fired without ammunition, it creates and shoots a small swarm of live locusts that bite and chew on the target. The wielder can make two separate attacks against two targets within five feet of each other and the swarm attacks both, dealing damage equivalent to a dagger and the weapon's effect to both creature's on hit. The locusts crumble to dust one round after being fired. —Note: It is up to the DM to determine how exactly an enemy is affected by this. Personally I suggest keeping track of the 1d4+1 hours of delayed food and drink on individual targets and considering the target “exhausted” when he has accumulated 8+ hours and perhaps have the target passing out from hunger and dehydration around the 12+ hours mark. This obviously won't have much of an effect on many types of creatures as undead, constructs, demons dragons and elementals don't eat and drink enough to be bothered by the enchantment but can provide a fun and powerful debuff to some large monster and powerful villains."
51,"The Lysis Blade: A longsword hilt wrapped in intertwined silver and steel wire. While grasping the hilt, the wielder can create a blade of wan, gray-green light that springs into existence or will the blade disappear. While the blade exists, the wielder can use it as a regular longsword and they can use either their strength or dexterity (Whichever is higher) to calculate their accuracy and damage rolls with the weapon. The celadon coloured blade is created of densely packed air bound in magic and foes cut with eldritch power that bypasses most physical and supernatural defenses to kill in the most direct way possible. Half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered force damage while the rest is normal for its type."
52,"Blister: A worn and heavily rusted dagger with a dirty bone handle. The goblin word for ""Blister” is carved crudely into the pommel. Based on the nature of the weapon it's not certain if “Blister” is meant to be a threat, warning or both combined into the weapon's name and its victim's curse. When the weapon is used to cut flesh, it creates large second degree burns all over the wound. The afflicted area becomes instantly marred with large red patches of reddened flesh, burn blisters and crisped peeling skin. The victim's flesh can be knitted together by medical or arcane means (All the hit point damage can be healing normally.) but the aesthetics of the burns themselves refuse to be scrubbed away by magic. The victim (Should they survive the encounter.) is left covered in tender, reddened skin that may ooze and bleed for weeks while it heals naturally. Half of the damage dealt by the dagger is considered fire damage while the rest is normal for its type."
53,"Evergreen Quarterstaff: A gnarled oaken quarterstaff made of living wood. Once per day, if the staff is planted in the ground in full sunlight and at least a liter of water is poured at its base, the staff will sprout a luscious purple berry over the course of one hour. Eating the delicious fruit is so satisfying that it counts as nourishment for a full meal and restored hit points equivalent to a shortsword's damage. The magical berry rots eight hours after it ripens and will no longer provide any benefit to a creature that consumes it. During the hour that it is planted, the oaken quarterstaff will repair itself of any scratches, nicks or breaks that it has suffered."
54,"Mudslinger: A sling so covered in dried mud and dirt that it is impossible to tell what kind of leather it's made from let alone determine any distinguishing marks. The caked on dirt never flakes off and the sling seems to actively resist any attempts to clean it. The sling can launch small rough hewn rocks just as easily as it would specially crafted sling bullets without penalty. If the wielder spends one round collecting and compounding a handful of dirt or mud into the sling pouch, it condenses into a solid piece of hard ammunition which can then be launched. The makeshift dirt ammunition flies as true as a proper bullet and returns to loose soil after impact or if it's out of the sling for more than six seconds. A creature holding Mudslinger feels a deep seeded jealousy for those able to slip the bonds of earth and take to the skies and craves to bring them down to their level. The weapon is treated as a +1 against targets that are not currently making contact with the ground (Such as flying, hovering or floating) or standing on a solid substance (See Note). Flying targets hit by a makeshift dirt bullet lose five feet of altitude in addition to being damage. The wielder must be making contact with the ground themselves to activate this ability and a creature capable of natural flight is never considered proficient with Mudslinger. —Note: Targets who are swimming, climbing or suspended from webs, strings or wires are not considered flying and DM's should enforce common sense based on the spirit of the enchantment."
55,"Twin Maces of The Heavens: A pair of heavily decorated, one-handed steel maces whose names are etched into their grips. “Helios” was forged to resemble the sun with his spikes forming sunbeams all covered in gold leaf that somehow remains unmarred and glows with a faint golden light. “Luna” was forged to resemble the moon with her spikes forming moonbeams all covered in silver that somehow remains unmarred and glows with a faint silver light. When both maces are wielded simultaneously by a single creature in direct moonlight or sunlight, they are treated as +1 weapons."
56,"Graveblade: A scimitar, simple and elegant in design, with vile runes running up and down its length and a large black gemstone set into the pommel. It smells of blood and grave dirt and small droplets of blood fall irregularly from the point of the sword when drawn. No matter the temperature of the surroundings, the weapon is always cool to the touch, sapping the heat from the wielder's hands. In dim light, the gem glows enough to stretch shadows, and occasionally breathing can be heard, seemingly from within the crystal. Half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered necrotic damage while the rest is normal for its type."
57,"Talon: A shortsword with a recurve blade that hooks forward at about a 45 degree angle, similar to a large kukri and bearing a gem carved to resemble a raptor's eye set in the pommel. When gripped, the wielder is overcome by an inescapable sense of pride and the weapon itself becomes as light as a feather. As long as the wielder is flying, hovering or floating the weapon is treated as a +1 against targets who are making contact with the ground or standing on a solid substance (See Note). —Note: Targets who are swimming, climbing or suspended from webs, strings or wires are not considered flying and DM's should enforce common sense based on the spirit of the enchantment."
58,"Claw of the Depths: A scimitar with a blade made of the curving claw of a deep sea monster, with a hilt encrusted with white and dark blue coral. The weapon is constantly damp and drips saltwater intermittently and when grasped, the wielder's ears pop as if subjected to a drastic change in pressure. If the weapon is completely submerged in saltwater it is treated as +1 for the next hour."
59,"Dragon's Claw: A longsword with a bone white blade, crafted from the claw of a flying serpent dragon. The weapon's hilt is adorned with the dragon's feathers and the hilt is wrapped in hair taken from its mane. The sword is as light as a feather, perfectly balanced and can be wielded as an offhand weapon just as easily as a small dagger if the wielder was fighting with two weapons. —Note: For dual wielding or two-weapon fighting purposes, the weapon is counted as a dagger or a “light weapon” for calculation negatives or penalties but otherwise has the weapon statistics of a longsword."
60,"Weapon of War: A heavy greatsword covered in variously aged nicks and scratches, suggesting this weapon has seen decades if not centuries of constant use. The weapon has a symbol of a horse and a greatsword etched onto its grip. The greatsword is covered in a red patina which upon close inspection is actually layers upon layers of bloodstains that have permanently stained the entire weapon. The nicks, scratches and stains can be removed through mundane or magic means but they spontaneously reappear the next time the weapon is used in combat. The bearer feels the faint but constant urge to slay living creatures and take peace from the earth. The blade rewards those who prove their worth over others in battle and if the weapon is used to land the killing blow on an intelligent creature in armed combat (See Note) the greatsword glows slightly and functions as a +1 for the next eight hours for that wielder only. Whenever the weapon is treated as a +1, it glows with a deep red light and the wielder has advantage to intimidate creatures if he threatens to kill them. The eight hour timer is reset each time the wielder meets the enchantment's requirements. —Note: The DM has some discretion on this but typically armed combat means that the fight is reasonable fair and that the target is conscious, able to fight, armed with a weapon and aware that they are fighting the wielder."
61,"Blade of Safe Handling: A small earthen-red, chef's knife shaped from ceramic. Its edge is incredibly sharp, enough to shave a face or peel a grape with, yet it feels blunt when pressed to the wielder's own skin. The dagger cuts through non-living materials with ease, but cannot harm living materials or creatures at all. In addition to serving as a sharp, yet safe kitchen utensil, the blade is useful while in combat and is treated as a +1 against non-living creatures and materials. The dagger never deals damage in any form to living creatures."
62,"Sacred Tecpatl: A knapped flint blade with a hilt made of a carved human femur. Any blood split from this dagger is considered a sacred ritual and the blood becomes an offering to the wielder's God. Blood spilled by the knife immediately burns to a crisp and plunging the knife into a still-beating heart reduces it to ash. Any time blood is spilled and the offering made, the wielder feels an intense rush of divine approval (Regardless of if their God would actually appreciate the sacrifice, which wise PC's will find suspicious), the pleasure of which can become an addiction. The fire of burnt offerings does not harm the wielder and half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered fire damage while the rest is normal for its type. Large offerings of blood do seem to be rewarded (Though it is uncertain whether the blade or their God is providing the blessing) and the wielder experiences a nearly orgasmic, divine zeal whenever he scores a critical hit or killing blow on a living creature who has blood. After landing such a blow the wielder's next attack made with it before the end of his next turn is made with advantage."
63,"Shifting Waters: An unremarkable steel dagger made of solid steel. On close inspection, an observer will notice that the metal of the weapon seems to flow slowly across the blade. With an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, the wielder can shift the blade with a thought into any other metal (Or mostly metal), one handed weapon they desire. The dagger seems to flow into its new form like water being poured into a shaped glass. The weapon reverts back into a dagger when not held."
64,"Wings of Death: A leather brace containing a dozen ornate throwing knives, whose handles are crafted to look like a pair of feathered wings folded around a human skull. Once thrown, the knives spread their wings and appears to fly towards their victims like a diving bird of prey. The target does not gain any benefit from physical cover as long as the wielder is able to see the target and there is a reasonably straight line of flight that the weapon can follow. Each individual knife can only be used once per week in this manner if they are recovered and still usable."
65,"Ray of the Dawn: A knight's war lance that seems to be made of solid sunlight. It weighs half as much as a typical lance and shines with the brightness of a candle in the reddish orange light of a new dawn. A creature struck by the weapon is treated as if they had been exposed to direct sunlight for one round. This can result in temporary blindness or sunlight sensitivity in some creatures and considerable damage to some types of undead. Outside of combat, the lance can be hung horizontally above a barely dressed creature and be used as a tanning light or to grow small amounts of plants in otherwise dark environments. To retain its enchantment, the weapon must spent at least one non-consecutive hour per week in direct natural sunlight, absorbing the solar energy and storing it within itself. If this requirement is not met, the lance's magic begins to fade and it enters a state of hibernation for up to 30 days during which time it does not glow or provide its combat bonus. To be brought out of hibernation the weapon must spent a total of eight consecutive hours in direct natural sunlight at which point it returns to normal functioning. If not brought out of hibernation within the 30 days the magic binding the sunlight into solid matter fades and the lance evaporates into nothingness."
66,"Thief's Regret: A butterfly knife with the symbol of an open eye etched on both sides of the blade. With the folding dagger on their person, the bearer feels protected against pickpockets, cutpurses and thieves. As long as the knife is in the bearer's possession, he has advantage any perception checks (Including passive checks) made to notice anything being stolen from his person. If the bearer succeed on such a check and notices a creature stealing from him, the knife teleports to one of the bearer's free hands with the blade drawn and he can make an immediate attack of opportunity with advantage on the attack roll against the thief before they are able to escape or withdraw."
67,"Rogue's Night Light: A functional black dagger with a long rectangular rubies inset into the sides of the blade. When held in one hand the wielder is able to will the weapon to flare into light, causing the gemstones to glow as bright as a candle with crimson light that only the wielder can see. This illumination does not inhibit the wielder's night vision in any way allowing the wielder to read secret documents, pick locks or sneak around traps in otherwise total darkness with ease. Other creatures who view this happening are not able to detect the light whatsoever."
68,"Spear of the Unpierced: A long spear made from bone, topped with a straight, helical horn bound to the bone with thick white hair. Knowledgeable PC's will discovery that all parts of the weapon originated from a singular unicorn. No matter its circumstances, the weapon remains free of scratches, nicks, sweat, blood and gore, remaining untouched as if saving itself. The weapon instills feelings of purity, patience and self-control when held. The weapon glows slightly and is treated as +1 when wielded by a virgin creature. —Note: Themes regarding sexuality may not be appropriate for all groups and DM's should use their discretion on if this enchantment is worth adding into their campaign or if it would be too distracting, immersion breaking or uncomfortable."
69,"Ebb Tide: A weighted net woven from the hair of the drowned, with heavy shells and chunks sea glass distributed around its edge. A knowledgeable PC will notice that the small etchings on the glass and shells, marks the net as blessed by a sea witch and given to mermaids in order to better drown the lonely men they lure into their watery domains. A creature entangled by the net has disadvantage on all checks made to swim, any rolls to resist drowning and can only hold their breath for half as long as normal. The weapon moves through water as easily as it does through air, suffering no penalties when attacking underwater targets."
70,"Mage's Hook: A brightly polished, steel, prosthetic hook hand that glows slightly when worn by a creature capable of casting magical spells. Made for mage's who have lost limbs, this hook counts as a working hand for the completion of any spells that require hand motions or somatic components. It can also be used in place of a hand for spells that require the caster to physically touch the target. Furthermore if the bearer of the hook is a missing a hand, and is capable of casting spells, they become proficient in the use of the hook as a weapon (Dagger statistics) and it is treated as a +1."
71,"The Emerald Blade: A jagged ^RandomSword^ lined with emerald teeth forming a gnashing edge. Whenever it inflicts a wound, live plants sprout from the lacerations instead of blood. These plants usually cause no more additional injury but the odd spontaneous growth of nature causes roots to spread directly into the victim's arteries, bones, nerves or interlocking joints, causing further pain and suffering. Whenever the player rolls the maximum result on the sword's damage die (I.e. a 6 on a six-sided die, see Note), they can roll that die an additional time and add both results to the total damage dealt. This ability can trigger multiple times per turn but only once per attack. If the bearer is injured while wielding the weapon, he bleeds sap rather than blood that quickly coagulates into a thick pad of lichen. Once per minute if the blade is plunged into the earth, luscious healthy grasses, clovers and wildflowers instantaneously sprout up one foot high, in a five foot radius around the sword. The plants are healthy and root if possible in whatever soil is available but afterwards they will live or die based on the local environment. The sword rests in a wooden scabbard set with a single sparkling amber gem. —Note: This only affects the weapon's damage itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects."
72,"Ishmael's Call: A wicked looking harpoon (Javelin statistics), made from the jagged, scrimshaw-carved tusk of a narwhal and attached to a 50-foot length of woven sinew. The wielder feels an extremely heightened drive to seek revenge on those who have harmed him physically and a nearly uncontrollable urge to kill those who have caused him to lose a limb. The weapon moves through water as easily as it does through air, suffering no penalties when attacking underwater targets. If the wielder has ahold of the end of the sinew rope in one hand and throws the harpoon with the other, after the weapon has hit of missed the target the wielder may call the harpoon back with a thought, causing it and the full length of rope instantly reappear in his hand. The weapon is treated as a +1 weapon if the wielder is missing a limb."
73,"Featherweight Darts, Tracking: A small wooden case containing a dozen extremely small, lightweight darts. These fragile darts have barbed needle-like heads which are too small to deal damage on their own. When a dart hits exposed skin, the thin shaft breaks off, leaving the base of the fine barbed head flush with the flesh and nearly impossible to spot. These tools are made to track lone or unintelligent prey who lack the awareness, help or resources to notice and remove the darts once embedded. Once a dart pieces the skin of a creature, it begins to emit light and noise to aid the wielder track the victim. Before firing, the wielder may focus on the dart to command it to glow with the intensity of a torch in any color the wielder chooses, and emit any sound the wielder can imaging up to as loud as a whistle blast. The wielder can alternate the colors, and sounds in order to create a loop of no more than six seconds. The wielder must make these choices before the dart is fired, and they cannot be changed afterwards. If no choices are made, the darts default to blue and red lights that alternate every other second with a piercing whistle blast every six seconds. The creature who has an active dart embedded in their flesh is completely unable to see or hear the light and sound the dart creates. A dart functions for one hour after penetrating flesh or until it is removed. In either case, an individual dart is destroyed after its purpose is served and cannot be reused. The barb can be removed without issue in one round with proper equipment and a successful medicine check or by quickly cutting out the barb dealing 1d2 damage. The small darts are meant to be used in both blowguns and wrist launchers but can be thrown by hand or fired from a hand crossbow while suffering disadvantage on the attack roll."
74,"Dragathil: A slightly curved rapier with a grip crafted perfectly for elf and human hands but will still accommodate other races. It has a row of small rubies down the center of the blade and a large basket hilt in the form of roses twined around three harps. Dragathil glows with a fierce red light when drawn, but despite its fearsome appearance, it is designed to subdue opponents peacefully rather than smite them with arcane fire or razor-sharp steel. The weapon is treated as a +1 but all of the damage dealt by it is considered non lethal / stun. The weapon leaves no visible marks of injury nor will it ever kill any of the targets struck by it. If a target would take damage that would result in death they are instead rendered unconscious, but stable. —Note: Some systems do not use non lethal / stun damage mechanics and this weapon may be more powerful because of that. In those cases a DM may use their discretion to rule that certain types of creatures such as undead, constructs, elementals or gelatinous cubes may be resistant or immune to the nonlethal damage caused by this weapon."
75,"Bolt to Freedom: A slick, wooden quiver covered in a glassy lacquer containing a dozen crossbow bolts. Each piece of ammunition is perpetually coated in a thin film of oil or grease. The bolts leave a thin, oily residue on everything they touch and targets hit by one become covered with a thin layer of grease. The slippery coating hinders the target's ability to become restrained or to restrain others. A creature hit by a bolt suffers disadvantage on any rolls made to initiate or maintain a grapple or restraint and gains advantage on any check made to break free of a grapple or restraint of any kind. This effect lasts until the start of the wielder's next turn."
76,"Legion-Breaker: A long, heavy-bladed bastard sword that has been the weapon of conquerors and revolutionaries alike. The edge is notched and scarred from centuries of warfare and the heavy, human-form brass hilt lends the blade a remarkable sense of balance for its size and weight. Unlike many magical weapons, this blade was not wrought to slay monsters or demons, but to empower the few to slaughter the many. The wielders of this blade often find themselves drawn to the forefront of rebellions, invasions and the defense of homelands from the endless hordes that clamor constantly at their border. During combat, the weapon surges with power when its wielder is outnumbered and when the wielder has more enemies than allies in battle the weapon is treated as a +1. The exception to this is when the wielder started with a smaller allied force than his enemy and slaughtered his way into superior numbers. The one who carries Legion Breaker into battle will never tire so long as he continues the fight. Wars consists of many protracted battles and dozens if not hundreds of skirmishes, raids and feinting pushes. If the weapon is treated as a +1 active combat, the wielder is able to ignore his fatigue and the wielder is rendered immune from any and all the negative effects from exhaustion that he may be suffering from. Once combat is over however the wielder is no longer sheltered by adrenaline and the effects of exhaustion return in full."
77,"Demonsorrow: A long, thin-bladed scimitar whose hilt resembles a beautiful angel with elven features. Elaborately detailed feathered wings spread from the hilt to form the guard, with the angel's face at the base of the blade. The cold iron crescent blade hinders those it was created to destroy, forcing them to turn on the wielder with extreme prejudice when would normally flee. When the scimitar is being wielded by a living creature it is treated as a +1 against demons and fiends and whenever such creature attempts to teleport while within 50 feet of the wielder, there is a 25% chance that the attempt fails, wasting the creature's action and spell resources. An abyssal creature barred from teleporting is aware that the scimitar is producing the effect, is imparted with the distance and direction of Demmonsorrow and knows that should the wielder die, the demon is free to leave."
78,"Crossbow of the Infinite Sky: A hand crossbow with infinity symbols engraved on both sides of its mother of pearl grip. The barrel is adorned with gold depicting the moon, planets, and stars against a night sky of the weapon's cold black steel. The crossbow never needs to be manually reloaded and after one shot is fired, a non magical bolt from somewhere on the wielder's person is teleported into the automatically restrung barrel. Unfortunately due to a quirk of the enchantment, the weapon can never be fitted with magical bolts of any kind, as it will not magically load them and the prideful crossbow refuses to be hand loaded like some sort of peasant's weapon."
79,"Halfling's Exit: A black leather pouch that contains a dozen grey sling bullets, each one seemingly filled with swirls of thick, black fog, their surface roiling with constant motion. These bullets provide a ready cover for those needing a quick escape and are often carried by rogues, infiltrators and assassins in case such situations arise. Upon impact with a target, the ammunition emits a deafening crack and releases a billowing cloud of smoke that fills a five foot square with dense black mist. If the target is a creature, the victim's space becomes engulfed in the opaque smoke and he effectively blinded but also gains full cover from outside attacks. All creatures within 30 feet of the impact are momentarily distracted and suffer disadvantage on visual perception checks until the start of the wielder's next turn. The dark fog is harmless, causing no injury and dissipating completely at the start of the wielder's next turn. A wielder proficient with slings suffers no penalty on their accuracy roll should they throw a bullet by hand at any space or unattended object (Including their own feet) within 15 feet, so that they can escape behind the smokescreen or to obscure a door or window."
80,"Cradle to Grave: A ritual dagger etched with spider web designs and a hilt shaped like a skeleton that has been laid to rest. The ceremonial blade prominently displays the holy symbol of Pharasma, the Goddess of birth, death, rebirth and prophecy. Knowledge PC's are aware that daggers like these are used during ceremonies sacred to the Lady of Graves, such as to cut umbilical cords of newborns or to preside over the corpses of the honored dead as their spirits travel to their resting place in the Great Beyond. The Goddess of the cyclical cycle of life, death and rebirth is well familiar with her domains and wishes them to happen smoothly and without interference by those who would disrupt the pattern with abominations. While the dagger is in the bearer's possession he is considered proficient in any medicine checks for the purposes of midwifery and childbirth. A newborn whose umbilical cord is severed with the knife is blessed by the Goddess and gains advantage on all constitution based checks and saves for the next seven days. A bearer who uses the dagger as part of an hour-long ritual of prayer over a corpse, bestows the protection of the Shepherd of Spirits over the empty vessel. The remains are protected from rot and decay and cannot become undead or be raised from the dead for a period of seven days. The goddess abhors the wretched undead and the dagger is treated as a +1 against undead creatures. A bearer who has ever created, raised, summoned or commanded an undead creature is not able to make use of the dagger powers, nor are they considered proficient in the weapon."
81,"Fateblade: An fairly unadorned ^RandomSword^, whose pommel is carved to look like a large unblinking eye. The twinned symbol of the Goddess of Fate and Death is stained into the weapon's grip with dried blood that refuses to be wiped away. The weapon appears to be a physical manifestation of destiny that allows its wielder to alter reality for their own personal gain. In combat, the wielder could swear that with each swing of the sword they experience two different simultaneous strikes against the target, in a sort of violent deja-vu. In the briefest fraction of time during the swing, the wielder can see the result of both strikes and can choose their own fate and that of their victim. Whenever the player rolls to determine the weapon's damage (See Note), he may roll the weapon's damage die twice and choose either result to use. After spending some time with the weapon in his possession, the bearer begins to receive strange new sensations of things yet to come and glimpses of the future begin to press in on his awareness. Some of these premonitions are flashes of second sight into the bearer's malleable destiny and can be exploited to reweave the threads of fate. After finishing a long rest during which the weapon has been in the bearer's possession, the player rolls 1d20 and records the number rolled. While the weapon is wielded by that specific bearer, he can choose to replace any attack roll made by the wielder or a creature that he can see with the foretelling roll. The wielder must choose to do so before the roll is made. The foretelling roll can be used only once and when the bearer finishes another long rest, he loses any unused foretelling rolls. —Note: This only affects the weapon's damage itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects."
82,"Blade Of The Sword-Saint: An exquisitely forged katana that is the result of painstaking attention and craftsmanship by one who was dedicated to mastering swordplay in its highest form. The implement draws upon its wielder's desire for the perfection of their martial style, distilling that dedication and energy into to a palpable force and releasing it towards the target. Each time the weapon swings in their direction, the target's mind is flooded with white hot needles of shame and inadequacy as they are made painfully aware that their weapon and fighting form are no match for the wielder's. Whenever the wielder attacks a creature, that target is dealt one point of psychic damage, even if the attack missed, was blocked or otherwise resisted."
83,"Stormbringer: A huge, finely-wrought zweihänder runesword (Fullblade statistics), with a blade at least five feet long from the hilt. The hilt itself is embedded with a large spherical ruby that resembles an eye. The blade is made entirely from an unearthly, vaguely flesh-like black metal, and is etched with mysterious runes so ancient that even extremely knowledgeable PC's cannot decipher. The runes can sometimes be seen to glow and change colour, cycling from red and purple to blue. Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of Stormbringer is that is has been instilled with a small amount of malicious intelligence, perception and memory, and that it is in some part alive and self aware. The wielder faintly perceives the weapon's simple mind at the edge of their consciousness and the giant sword is quite vocal, with a near constant telepathic chatter of screaming, grumbling, howling, murmuring, moaning, and even singing at times. The weapon is able to perceive its environment in the same way a human can (Sight, smell, sound etc.) to a maximum of a five foot radius around itself. Stormbringer can answer simple fact based, or yes/no questions about its origin, history, past wielders, targets it struck, etc. The fullblade does not lie but is not able to answer complex questions or those that depend on feelings, extensive logical deductions or situations it has never witnessed. In combat the weapon becomes wreathed in black light and dark fire and it screams in battle with such force that half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered thunder damage while the rest is normal for it's type. Due to this effect, the wielder automatically fails any stealth checks made while Stormbringer is used in combat."
84,"Mah'alleinir: A warhammer measuring about four feet long, with a large brick shaped head, a long metal handle, and the imprint of a leaping wolf on the side of its head. It resembles an oversized blacksmith's hammer more than it does a “traditional” warhammer and it sports a wedge-shaped back in place of the typical armor-piercing spike common on typical warhammer designs. After three days in the possession of a bearer who has never deliberately harmed or killed a wolf, the bearer's eyes become a bright yellow even golden color, glow faintly in the dark and catch the light, granting a wolfish appearance. This effect fades 24 hours after the weapon has left the wielder's possession. A wolf eyed wielder takes on some of the heightened senses of the untamed wolf and can see in low or dim light as if it was bright light and gains advantage to any perception checks made regarding their sense of smell. Wolves are pack hunters and a golden eyed bearer instinctually benefits from a nearby ally while in combat, using the minor distraction to go for the enemy's throat. The wielder gains a +1 on damage rolls with Mah'alleinir if an allied creature is within five feet of the target. Bearers who have ever harmed or killed wolves feel a strong sense of betrayal and revulsion when touching the warhammer and they cannot benefit from its magic nor are they considered proficient with the weapon."
85,Wuuthrad: A two-handed greataxe with blades on both sides. The weapon has a long ebony handle that leads to its twin-bladed head and ends in a sharp point at the top. The weapon is coloured almost entirely in a muted grayish tone and prominently features the face of a screaming elf on the head of the axe. The mighty axe was hewn from sorrow in the wake of a great lost and Knowledgeable PC's understand the weapon's name translates to “Storm's Tears” in the ancient language of Atmora. The greataxe is particularly deadly against elves and is treated as a +1 weapon against them and elven creatures are never considered proficient with Wuuthrad.
86,"Mind Killer: An illithid wrought greatsword whose hilt is swaddled in fine leather harvested from the past victims of mind flayers. The blade resembles a great black tentacle with phosphorescent green veining running through its sinuous length. The weapon grants its wielder a form of extrasensory perception that straddles the line between superhumanly insightful and true psionic power. An experienced wielder with a discerning mind gains a sudden flash of understanding after striking the enemy and is able to make educated guess on the foe's next move and defend accordingly. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a target with a lower wisdom score than himself, the wielder's armor class or physical defensiveness increases as if he was properly wielding a shield (Typically a +2) against the next attack made by the target until the end of its next turn."
87,"Silver Sickle of Soranth: A silver sickle forged in the shape of a crescent moon. The handle is made of duskwood, wrapped in the blackened leather of a werewolf pelt. Four pictographs (One on each side of each blade) depict one of the elements killing a wolf like beast. One shows the canine drowning, one shows the canine burning, one shows the canine being crushed under a rock, and one shows the canine gasping for air. The silvered weapon is treated as a +1 against shapeshifters and lycanthropes, and such creatures are never considered proficient with the sickle."
88,"The Fountain of Infinite Gore: A huge square bladed greatsword that was originally a giant's cleaver whose handle has been replaced. The heavy blade has a triangular cross-section and is truly menacing to behold. A red string it wound tightly around the tip of the handle and a small golden ring dangles down from the grip. The weapon's butchering design allows the wielder's blows to potentially carve through multiple foes at a time on particularly lethal attacks. Once per round when the wielder scores a critical hit with the weapon or reduces a creature to 0 hit points with it, he can immediately make an additional attack with the weapon against a creature within reach. The repurposed cleaver's lethal design is so murderously effective that the wielder can never choose to deal nonlethal or stun damage with it and whenever the wielder deals enough damage to bring an enemy to 0 hit points or less and has the choice between incapacitating or killing them, the wielder must always kill them."
89,"God's Tongue: One-handed mace made from an electrum alloy, divinely enchanted to become stronger than steel. The holy symbol of the God of ^GoodDomains^ is stamped into the grip, and presses into the wielder's hand when held .The weapon is a smooth blend of silver and gold, with the grip being made of pure silver and the tip of the mace's head being pure gold, with a blending of the metals in between. The weapon's crushing flanges are a pristine work of art, cast in white gold and polished to a near mirror sheen. The mace will never allow itself to touch the earth and if dropped, will stop falling an inch above the ground and simply hover until picked up. The weapon is immaculately fresh, dirt, grime, and blood simply falls away from it, leaving it forever gleaming and clean. If banged on an object, the area around the mace will be filled with the sounds of hymns and chanting as loud, as if the air itself were a bell extolling the God's greatness. This effect is a loud as five grown men yelling and lasts until the mace is no longer held, the bearer chooses to suppress the effect or until ten minutes passes. The mace functions as a direct spiritual connection to the deity and a creature make offerings directly to the God in return for a minor blessing. The bearer may lay ten gold coins (See Note) along the surface of the lethal flanges and pray to the God for ten minutes. At the end of this ritual, the gold coins vanish and the weapon is treated as a +1 weapon for the next eight hours but only for the creature who prayed. The bearer feels a strong sense of religious devotion during the eight hour span and feels motivated to carry out the basic tenets of the domain the God represents. The wielder is not compelled to act in this way and is not forced to violate any strongly held morals or beliefs. —Note: Rather than a flat ten gold, the DM can rule of another flat value, X gold per character level or other reasonable amount."
90,"Amorphous Axe: A mutable greataxe, seemingly made from solid mercury, enchanted to maintain whatever lethal shape that will best serve its wielder. The liquid metal of the weapon flows in a never ending current, traveling upwards from the wielder's hand to the tips of the blade before coming back down. This effect is intensified by the tightening of the wielder's grip, creating ripples of metal heated by body temperature which rise and mix with the cooler mercury near the top, creating small eddies and whirlpools that can be soothing to gaze upon. The implement bears enchantments of the school of wizardly divination and when new enemies come within the wielder's reach, the axe's business end shifts and wavers. Truly a weapon forged for every hand, as the spelled mercury constantly detect resistances, immunities and weaknesses in the physical forms of nearby creatures and automatically adjusts itself to best injure its targets. When the wielder makes an attack, the weapon instantly changes its business end to become sharper, pointier or blunted in order to bypass any resistances the target has or to capitalize on any vulnerabilities. Furthermore if the foe is susceptible to silver or cold iron, the weapon's shimmering liquid draws forth a measure of silver or cold iron shavings normally hidden within to coat its business end, causing the weapon to be considered silvered or made of cold ion. Other than the damage types, the weapon's statistics, required proficiencies and general use does not change. After each strike, the weapon reverts to its standard greataxe shape and the silver and cold iron retreat back into the weapon's core, showing no indication that it ever changed. —Note: A combat example; If the wielder of Amorphous Axe (Which normally deals slashing damage) attacks demon that's immune to slashing and piercing damage and is resistant to all non silvered weapons, the Amorphous Axe would change to be considered a silvered weapon that deals bludgeoning damage when attacking that demon."
91,"Mutually Assured Destruction: A dark-colored greatsword of Abyssal design, sporting a circling guard and a pommel embedded with a luscious purple gem. The expertly cut jewel contains the trapped soul of a petty warlock who accomplished nothing of note with his powers before his contract ended. Caged in an endless cycle of pain, torture and misery, the eternal suffering of his eldritch spirit serves as fuel for the sword's catastrophic power. When the weapon is taken up and used the soul gains the opportunity to channel a small fraction of his never ending agony out of his inescapable prison, providing himself a brief moment of respite at the cost of everyone else involved. A bearer can feel this malicious energy stirring within the weapon's confine's, longing to be released to wreak havoc on the righteous and the wicked alike. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a creature, the wielder can choose to loose the warlock's curse upon the world. If he does so, the wielder and the target both suffer disadvantage on their next significant action (Typically an attack, saving throw or skill check) as the demonic force plagues them with woe. The warlock's spite over his anguish used to empower the weapon transcends the imprisoning gemstone and he maintains a hex on any who wield the blade, drawing violence towards the wielder like a strong magnet, making it noticeable easier for the wielder's foe's to kill him. The weapon is treated as a +1 but while the weapon is being wielded and for one hour afterwards, the bearer suffers a penalty of -1 to his armor class or other similar physical defenses."
92,"Death's Scythe: A simple farmer's tool made for reaping crops that has been repurposed into a weapon made for reaping lives. The scythe is pale and ashen with the words “To Know Me Is To Oppose Me.” carved into the wood just above the grip and the symbol of a horse and a human skull etched onto its grip itself. The bearer feels the morbid urge to witness the deaths of as many creatures as he can manage, especially those of his own race. This urge is more macabre curiosity rather than homicidal in nature and does not necessarily encourage the wielder to murder directly, but will encourage the bearer to do nothing but watch rather than staunch the wound of a creature bleeding out. If the bearer personally witnesses the death of a creature of their own species (As in human, elf or dwarf, not just another humanoid), the weapon glows slightly and is treated as a +1 for the next eight hours for that wielder only. Whenever the weapon is treated as a +1, the wielder's pupil's glow with pinpricks of blue light and he can receive visions when he touches the corpse of a creature whose death he did not personally witness. During this time, he views the last six seconds of the creature's life from its perspective and experiences it in perfect detail. The eight hour timer is reset each time the wielder meets the enchantment's requirements."
93,"Spinal Tap: A long chain made of several human spinal cords bound together with sinew, interspersed with long spikes of sharpened bone. The four foot long, abomination of a weapon is filled to the brim with necromantic energy, strengthening the bones to the point of steel, rendering them impervious to common breakage. The spiked chain's enchantments are designed to empower themselves on the pain and blood of the weapon's victims and thus the spillover of black magic is all but guaranteed. Whenever the wielder lands a critical hit, the weapon becomes overwhelmed with perverse energy and discharges it into the nearby area. This causes a miasma of necromantic power to coalesce around the nearest corpse within 100 feet. The body rises from the dead as a zombie or skeleton and immediately attacks the nearest living creature to itself. The undead will continue to be hostile to the closest living being (Whoever that happens to be at the start of its turn) until it is destroyed or after one minute passes at which time the magic animating it fails and it crumbles in a heap. The sheet amount of condensed necromantic magic reaches out to the bearer, who is occasionally distracted with sights and sounds that only he can perceive; faint whispers of forbidden utterances in, visions of unholy symbols and quasi-memories of black rituals. When the weapon is used to kill, it leaves a seed of necromantic energy in the resulting corpse. This spark of unholy flame can be fanned by conventional necromantic spells if they are cast before the black fire burns itself out. A living creature dealt a killing blow by Spinal Tap, only needs half of the costly material components (Such as onyx gems, rare incense or diamonds) that the spell requires need in order to raise it as an undead creature. This benefit lasts for one hour after the creature is killed after which it requires the normal amount of materials. —Note: The zombie acts on the turn immediately after the caster and the DM can use wolf statistics for the undead's equivalent statistics for hit points, attacks, size, etc if no better option is available. At higher levels of play, dire wolf statistics can be used to keep this weapon relevant. For example, if Animate Dead is cast on a corpse and it would normally need an onyx gem worth 50 gp, the weapon's enchantment reduces that cost to a gem worth only 25 gp for one hour after the creature is killed by the weapon."
94,"Tinderstrike: An uncommonly sharp flint dagger from which cascades sparks off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for minutes after it is used to deal damage. Tinderstrike contains a spark of Imix, the archomental Prince of Evil Fire and the tiny fragment of his essence influences the bearer, encouraging him to act impatient and rash. A long term bearer may discover his personality changing, finding that he may be acting without thinking and taking risks without weighing the consequences. The bearer is never forced to act on these feelings but so long as he carries the weapon he may be swayed by its influence. The dagger is not without benefit however and the shred of the prince's pure elemental power trapped within it grants a limited mastery over fire. The wielder can choose nonmagical flames that he can see within 60 and that fits within a five-foot cube and cause simple shapes (Such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location) to appear within the flames and animate as he likes. The shapes last for one hour or until the wielder dismisses them. Twice per day, the wielder can create a bonfire on ground that he can see within 40 feet, using an action equivalent to making an attack or casting a spell. The bonfire fills a five-foot cube and lasts until doused, the wielder dismisses it or until one minute passes. Any creature in the bonfire's space when it appears or who pass through its space for the first time takes damage equivalent to a dagger. Tinderstrike's fiery power deal burning injuries and half of the damage dealt by the dagger is considered fire damage while the rest is normal for its type."
95,"Blade of the Last Light: A masterfully crafted longsword with silver lettering. Engraved on the flats of the blade are the words “Do not go gently into the night…” and “Rage, rage against the dying of the light.” A creature holding the sword feels a sense of hidden potential and sacred perseverance from it. When the wielder's health drops below half of his maximum hit points (Rounded down), the longsword's blade bursts into pure white flames as bright as a torch, resembling holy fire. While the sword is sheathed in fire, the weapon is treated as a +1 and half of the damage dealt by the weapon is considered radiant damage while the rest is normal for its type. The fire is extinguished if the wielder regains hit points so that he is above half-health or if the weapon is no longer being actively wielded."
96,"Swordbow: A beautiful weapon of elven design, with the words “Always Ready” carved in elven on the side of both its forms. Once per round on his turn, the wielder can concentrate for a fraction of a moment (Taking an action equivalent to drawing a weapon), to cause the weapon to instantaneously transform from a longsword into a longbow or back again. Both weapons are of masterwork quality and their grips amplify every tiny movement of the wielder's hands, allowing it to respond even the smallest flick of the wrist. The precise movement of both weapons allow the wielder to execute accurate strikes, granting a +1 on attack rolls to hit targets."
97,"Quickstep Dagger: A steel dagger, long and slim with a tapering point. Its sole marking or decoration is a white line which curls around the handle and shifts over the course of the day. A creature who has carries the dagger for at least the past three days will develop a fondness for it and has the nagging sensation that the weapon feels the same way and that the blade doesn't wish to be parted from its wielder for more than a few seconds. Once per day just before throwing the dagger, the wielder can establish an instant emotional connection to the weapon instilling feelings of closeness and togetherness within the blade. Immediately after being thrown, the dagger concentrates on these feelings and pulls the wielder towards itself. The creature instantly transforms into a mist and immediately travels 15 feet closer to the dagger and resolidifies. If this movement would put the wielder within five feet of the weapon, he appears clutching it."
98,"The Mourning Star: A morningstar with a hilt of carved bone and a head of carved tombstone spiked with coffin nails. If the wielder is feeling great pain at the loss of a loved one, the name of that being will appear on the weapon's shaft, chiseled like an ancient grave marker. The name remains there until the pain of the loss subsides or the wielder has avenged the death. The weapon is treated as a +1 against any creature who was directly responsible for the death of the loved one. The weapon can only display one name at a time and the bearer has no control over the name. The solemn weapon doesn't care for flings, acquaintanceship, flights fancy or puppy love and recognizes only true devotion and meaningful emotional connections, romantic, familial or platonic. In order to qualify as a “loved one” (According to the weapon) the wielder must have had regular contact with the creature for over a year or have spent the majority of their waking hours in the creature's presence for at least six consecutive months. —Note: The DM has full discretion over whose name can appear on the weapon and who is treated as a +1 against. There shouldn't be more than 1-5 creatures responsible for a death. If the wielder's child was murdered by an invading army for example, the weapon might be a +1 against the individual soldier who killed her, the sergeant or officer that gave the order to kill and perhaps the king that the army serves. It would not be a +1 against every soldier in the army."
99,"Darkstaff: A twisted black quarterstaff that appears to be made of wispy strands of shadow, woven together into a solid form. The wielder of the staff can choose to sheath the staff in their own shadow rather than in a sling or pack. While sheathed the staff effectively ceases to exist, although the bearer still feels its weight evenly distributed about their entire body. The bearer can retrieve the staff by reaching into their own shadow and pulling it out. If the bearer's shadow is not visible, such as in pitch darkness or bright light from multiple angles, the staff is irretrievable. If the bearer dies while the staff is sheathed, it will reform in the nearest shadow to the bearer."
100,"Blackrazor: A greatsword whose black blade shines like a piece of the night's sky filled with starts. The weapon radiates evil like a sour odor, and a morally good or ambivalent owner never knows if he wields the weapon, or if it wields him. A truly black hearted wielder knows that the greatsword's malicious nature guides his actions but he revels in that knowledge and uses it to become monstrously effective in combat. The sword's black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut obsidian. The weapon is treated as a +1 when wielded by an evil creature."
