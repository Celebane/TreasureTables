1,"Book of Letters: A portfolio containing examples of official letters along with proper forms of address, etiquette, and turns of phrase. Though this typically would be used by bureaucrats, diplomats, and clerks, it's also useful for counterfeiting official correspondence."
2,"Libra Daemonicus: A general exploration of daemons, their desires, and their various castes by an ancient mage. The book is kept in a beautifully decorated ceramic traveling case that can be fastened to the bearer's breastplate or hung from a chain around the neck. While many of the text's rituals are suspect (Possibly to ensure the death of any would-be rivals who might steal and use it), its lengthy discussion of appropriate sacrifices and a listing of true names for many lesser demons remain invaluable for those in possession of a copy. The text contains no more and no less than 666 words."
3,"A heavily weighted book entitled “Dost Thou Even Hoist, My Brother? A Treatise on the Matter of Lifting Purses”. The author is listed simply as “Longfingers”."
4,"Memoirs of a War Mage: A plain-looking and rather unimpressive cloth-bound book, the pages of this text follow an unnamed elven wizard as he recounts his first-hand experiences during the two years he fought in the Cormanthor War. A somber, and at times gut-wrenching read that details the highs and lows of the wizard's struggles for victory and survival against a brutal and ruthless enemy. The author provides a wealth of sage-advice regarding casting spells under pressure, making tactical decisions under stress, and how to best maintain focus and clarity of mind in the face of abject terror and darkness."
5,Handbook of Recursion: A strange tome describes a dice-based game in which the players describe their actions and roll dice to determine the outcome. It sounds like many an adventure could be had with this curious hobby.

They are a collection of predictions concerning the future of the forgotten land of Tyria and the survival of humans in the face of great and terrible events that would engulf their world.
7,"A Role Most Critical: An epic tale of seven people and their quest to save the world. In addition to written words, the book reads the text aloud with a unique rich voice for each of the main character's as well as the narrator."
8,"Woddeley's Occult Primer: A textbook that is almost certainly the very first to be read by any student wizard at the start of his first year at Unseen University. Unlike many of the more potent tomes at the University, this book is not magical in and of itself leaves its reader unscathed, and totally untroubled by any of the things that might beset a non-wizard who tries to read from a really potent grimoire. Woddeley's is counted as the ideal primer for fledgling wizards as one can read the book cover to cover without having their brain liquefied and trickle out of their ears or having their eyes melt out of their sockets. When placed on its worn spine, this particularly dog-eared copy naturally opens to Chapter 15: Elementary Necromancy, whose first line read “First, you need a spade…”"
9,"Of God and Man: A tome written by a cleric from long ago who wished to witness the birth of a divine being. But through his travels he found the secret way to end a God's life. This book contains the incantations to strip a God of their power, how to trap a deity, and lastly how to kill one. It is important to note that the cleric seems to be a devoutly religious man and that the incantations have never been actually tested, causing a suspicious reader to wonder why he ever wrote something like this down."
10,Knowing Your Lycanthrope: A dog-eared guidebook for those wishing to keep werewolf slaves for hunting dogs. The instructional text of supernatural canine husbandry is bound in thick animal hide trimmed in course black fur.
11,"A field book and reference guide for elven rangers, forest wardens and woodsmen entitled “Forestry For Beginners, How To Spend Your First Thousand Years Caring For Your Forest”. The book is in remarkable good shape considering how old it probably is."
12,"Journeys of the Celestial Spheres: A paperback book of middling quality. The copy is a single edition of a regularly published series with multiple authors on the subject of astrology. It has a special focus on the movements and orbits or planets, moon and comets."
13,"Advanced Goblin Breeding: A wood bound text which is the third volume of a ten book series on goblin husbandry. This text has a specific focus on breeding goblins over a period of several centuries to a millennium in order to create a new sub race with specific desirable traits such as gills, additional arms or improved endurance."
14,"A thick historical tome entitled “Hedge Mazes And Thorn Walls, The Art And Science Of Defensive Gardening”. The text provides a wealth of information on the subject covering any question or possible variation of defensive structure or type of plant, ranging from common bramble hedges around a simple fort, to surrounding a major metropolis with fields of magical poppies to treant and animated plant husbandry."
15,"A historical text of dubious validity entitled “Human Origins”, constructed of cheap pulp materials. The contents have a heavy anti-human agenda and claims that the first humans were made when apes and giant interbreeded in lustful perversion. The book logically concludes that humans are not part of the true natural order and should be exterminated entirely."
16,"A large atlas entitled “The Shattered World” that contains records of all of the great cataclysms of history that shaped and wrecked the world. The book's opposing pages have historical and modern maps, allowing the reading to easily compare the changes in borders, cities and natural resources."
17,"Doppelgangers, Changelings, Mimics, and Other Disguised Creatures: How to Tell Myth from Reality: A purple, cloth-bound tome that is one of the best sources for researching the nature of creatures which can shift their appearance.

Peatchokes, rabbits, moss, giant grouse eggs, bark, and odd chard are all included and listed with their favored methods of preparation, usually involving copious measures of salt and butter."
19,"Forsworn: A compendium of oathbreakers; this book details short stories of seemingly honorable, efficacious and well liked figures who, for compelling personal reasons, seemed to renounce their ardent rites and responsibilities. The book almost seems to be more like case studies of how to convince others to break their vows, ethics and faith rather than warning the reader to avoid falling into similar pitfalls."
20,"The Ode of Salutiene: A winding yarn of an epic poem, barely readable by common folk, either in translations or in its original script. Up until the very culmination of its meandering plot, which involves a fictional sea commander from the last century, the work makes little sense, stabbing with vague purpose at intangible points regarding life and the nature of the world. Only at its end does the Ode come together in a revelatory and epic conclusion."
21,"A sturdy, dirt stained tome entitled “The Floor is Lava - A Guide to Digging Deeper and how to Avoid Going too Deep.”."
22,"Atlas of the Weak: A wide book containing a number of maps showing locations of tribes, towns, or other groupings that the author deems weak. There are creepy notes within the margins that detail certain individuals and how easy they could be to manipulate."
23,"The Well of Catosene: An epistolary report by a fictional co-leader on a venture to the eponymous Well of Catosene. Despite its pretenses at being fiction, it is rumored that the work is actually fact, and the details within, all horrible, trapped, and gilded, make up a very real account of a typical ancient ruin."
24,"The Grand Schools of Magic Conspiracy: A long, bound master's thesis that claims that all schools of magic are in a grand conspiracy to limit arcane knowledge. By convincing people there are only eight schools or classes of magic, the order of wizards that secrete rule the world squash any ideas of new and unique magic powers. The author claims that the concept of the eight schools of magic is a conspiracy spread by the archwizards to limit unknown threats to their arcane might."

29,"This Much was True: A nonfiction account of the story of noted letter-forger Whilhemina Alslindova de Since, a dangerous woman of high skill and uncertain national origin. What became quite certain, after her eventual arrest, was her incredible skill at recreating both the handwriting and quality of speech of any given writer. During her trial, Alslindova recounted the creation of over 500 letters in the style of some 105 people, many of whom were high officials. For all, she was paid generously by anonymous buyers, who dictated the falsehoods to be written within. The forger's art is discussed in usable detail in said trail proceedings."
30,"The Last Alive: A chilling tale of adventure and betrayal written in first person. As the adventurers found a powerful magic ring that allows for control over a powerful monster, they argued over who should keep it. Over the course of several months they whittled down their own numbers until there were two left. The author currently has the ring according to the last chapter. Their location is unknown because the last page has been torn out."
31,"A leather bound journal. Anything the bearer writes in this journal will appear to them as a language they cannot comprehend. If they show what they have written to someone else, the reader will see a lie they have told. Showing two readers the same writing will show each a lie of their own, not a lie the other has told."
32,"Three Deaths at Lastimorny House: A fictional thriller concerning detective Leeligan Cyrl, of Kempt, called to great Lastimorny House to investigate three deaths during a long and debaucherous soirée. Her investigation features amusing, shocking interviews with numerous characters scandalously based on real aristocrats suspected of holding special fancies or odd desires. The culprit, in the end, it revealed to be a covert member of the Holy Inquisition, sent to put an end to a glut of perceived sin. All three murders were carried out using some manner of poison, the author's descriptions of which are strangely accurate."
33,"Time Lies: A posthumous memoir of horologist Jaccob Jarrows, of Leant, a maker of clocks. A professional shrouded in the superstition and mystique of his art. Folk all over the kingdom believed him and practitioners like him, those with power over time, to be mighty indeed. Jarrows, a man who held no ounce of personal spirituality nor superstition, recounts in this memoir stories of others' belief in his supposed power. At the start, he tells of how he disregarded their belief, their requests for magical aid. He resisted the mystique for years, kept to the simple, honest art of clockwork. By the end, though, he describes how he humored them, gifted oddly-functional placebos in the form of altered watches and illusions of twisted time. Lies, but magic all the same."
34,Cornelia's Diary: A leather back book filled with poems and stories from a woman who spent five years in the Nine Hells.
35,"The Agora Apocalyptica: A book that describes the end of the world in great detail. The name and a vague description of the most compassionate and self-sacrificing PC is mentioned several times, too often and to specific to be a coincidence…"
36,"Twenty to a Hundred Boots: A telling of one of the most hideously-catastrophic military debacles of the last three centuries. A tale of a scout gone lost in the dry, brown hills of a southern kingdom, then inhabited by bands of rebels against that peninsular power. A mission was mounted to save him. A second scout was sent to reconnoiter it and came back reporting the enemies holding the first numbered twenty to a hundred boots. Simply put, this was a verbal miscommunication and terrible understatement. The actions based on this bad intelligence began scattered fighting and confused routs all the countryside over. The original scout was never found."
37,A pocket field guide that details the small dragon-like lizards of the Underdark in terms of their habits and ecology.
38,"The History of This: A weathered tome that records its own histories. Inside it covers a large ballad of epic wars and duels between kings, mages, liches, dragons, angels, demons and even one goblin. The last 200 pages just mentioned people idly taking it off a bookshelf and putting it back in an almost saddened tone."
39,"Cooking With Friends; The Culinary Art of Cannibalism by Gher Dirtgrinder: The only known book ever written by a gnoll. Bound with patchwork skins, the calligraphy is surprisingly elegant and even includes images and butchering lines."
40,"Hag Reproduction; A Theory: A dissertation penned by a detail oriented wizard describing the process of how hags reproduce by devouring children. The second half of the dissertation describes a theory of how hags could potentially reproduce in a more ‘traditional' manner. The proposed process involves a long series of incantations and wards, a special elixir distilled from the reproductive organs of both a succubus and an incubus, and an odd emphasis on candles and 'mood appropriate' music."

45,"U is for Ustilagor: A Light-Hearted children's book about Ustilagor, the prepubescent form of Intellect Devourers. Despite their rather horrifying origins, the book is surprisingly gore-free; a strange detail when considering the book was “written” by an Elder Brain."
46,"Midnight: A pulp romance novel by Stephanie Mayors about a young necromancer named Stella, who finds herself torn between a skeleton and a zombie. Should she choose the new mysterious skeleton whose crystallized bones glisten, and he never stops staring.

Despite this fact, you can detect no obvious gaps in the volume's coverage of its subject matter."
51,"A volume of text that appears to be the original, handwritten manuscript of the Saga of the Warrior Prince Augustin, a classic ballad composed by the legendary bard Dathorn, famous for its lyrical quality and epic subject matter.

70,"101 Ways to Eat Rations: A sturdy leather bound handbook detailing (As one might imagine) 101 different ways to prepare and eat standard travel rations in order to bring out different flavors, textures and tastes.

74,"Amazingly Deadly Elements: First-Person Advice On Inner Interplanar Travel: A sturdy grey tome of unknown origin written by 'The Traveler', this text presents the reader with five chapters: Ethereal, Air, Earth, Water and Fire, ending with the promise of a soon to be published sequel on the Outer Planes. Each chapter is a collection of entries, written in the style of a diary, describing various daily happenings and dealings with creatures on the corresponding plane of existence. It makes for an unengaging read as the narrator often focuses on topics of very little interest, such as the type of soil they stand on or how clean the teeth of a creature are, and the descriptions evolve into rants that go on for many pages. However, the book presents genuinely good advice, with tips on how to deal with the extreme conditions of each plane and its inhabitants… If one is able to stomach the awful pacing, that is."
75,"Riv Stecke's Guide to Fey Crossings: A book that aids its reader in finding the nearest fey crossing to make their way into the Feywild. Most of the fey crossings listed have ceased to function due to being over-run with travelers since the publication of this book. However, a few of them still work."

82,"The Skull: A heavy book filled with a long stream-of-consciousness narrative describing a single humanoid skull in careful detail.

Perceptive PC's can parse that this might have once been an instructional swimming book. Exceptionally perceptive PC's realize that there might be something special about the ink that will reveal itself when submerged in water. When submerged in water, the text becomes a plainly legible instructional book about several basic swimming forms, as well as instructions on how to hold one's breath for minutes at a time while free diving."

100,"A battered looking traveler's journal. The book originally details the day to day routine of an unfulfilled third son of a minor merchant. The writer (Who never gives his own name) is approached on day by believers of the “True Faith of the Primal God” who fill him with stories of miracles on earth and the glories of the faithful. The journal details his interest in the new faith and a bright promising future through the religion. He meets higher ranking members of the faith who've been granted “Gifts” which ranged from magical and supernatural powers to mutations such as extra eyes, limbs or dramatically increased senses or strengths. As the writer becomes indoctrinated he notices that the higher ranked the other members are the more aloof and neurotic they seem to become… His handwriting begins to noticeably degrade as he progresses quickly up the ranks and recruits more followers himself. His devotion to the Primal God is rewarded with powers of his own. The writer only vaguely refers to his powers explaining that he doesn't want to describe them in detail in case: “They area reading this, and try using it against me…” in his own words. The writer becomes more paranoid and erratic and occasionally shifts into various simple codes and ciphers. Near the end of the writing, the author has apparently become one of the high priests in the cult and hears the voice of the Primal God in his head on a near constant basis. The voice fills his waking hours with warnings of danger and threats to his life originating from the people around him, especially the other cult members. The journal losses any sense of coherency and becomes a jumbled mess of paranoia, violence and strange magic… As far as the reader can tell, the writer kills a majority of the other cultists before retreating while mortally wounded to write the last few pages. The author last pages are fairly lucid and he details in a shaking hand how the others are all just as paranoid as he was and he thinks that the “Primal God” is really just a God of Chaos and Destruction in disguise. The last line of the journal takes up two entire pages, written in what you assume to be the writer's own blood. It reads “The Gifts are different for each of us, but the Curse is the same.” The writing is large firm and bold, similar to the writing from the beginning of the journal. Perhaps in his last moments he remembered who he used to be…"
