2,"A crown made of carved and polished ash with gold inlays."
3,"A heavy gold circlet decorated with laurel leaves. Almost buried among the laurel leaves of the crown are the sharp points of miniature swords.

6,"A twisted crown of jagged iron. All who regard the bearer feel a deep instinct that he is a legitimate political threat, though they are not forced to act on these emotions."

Whenever the crown is placed on a head, an personal ideal flows into the bearer's mind like a line of poetry long forgotten but suddenly remembered.

8,"A delicate circlet woven from silver wire that bestows upon its bearer perfect posture at all times."

38,"An electrum tiara set with a finely cut, clear quartz stone that glows slightly in dim light."
39,"A crown of a martial lineage, its solid steel frame offers protection similar to an actual helmet, with enough gold decorations to allow it to pass as decoration. A fine mesh of silver plated steel links hangs down from the temple to chin with open areas for the eyes. The chainmail allows the wearer to see outwards with minimal impairment while offering protection from small shrapnel.

75,"A dull and pock-marked cast iron crown with a simple maker's mark along the inside (A pair of pliers).

92,"A single piece of black iron, cast into the form of a flaming headpiece. The craftsmanship is harsh and the iron is filled with impurities that leave the surface coarse.

99,"A malleable crown that when not worn appears to be made of an indeterminate greyish metal. Close inspection reveals the phrase “The Land and the King are One.” boldly stamped on the crown's interior. When when donned, the crown immediately changes form to match the bearer's moral alignment and personality, becoming a physical reflection of their character. These changes fade the moment the crown is removed from the bearer's head."
100,"A powerful crown of bright gold, with a red velvet lining. Its central cap rises to a point, higher than the ten other points spaced around the rim. Each tip has a large ruby set into it, while the ruby in the front center is as large as a hen's egg. Each ruby glows with an inner, silver light. This beautiful, ancient crown amplifies the natural charisma of its wearer, making him an awe-inspiring figure. An extremely knowledgeable PC will recognize it as the infamous Miceram, worn by the legendary kingpriests of Istar."
