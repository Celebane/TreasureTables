3,"A suit of padded armor consisting of a billowing assemblage of earth-coloured cloth that seems to flow with the wind as if made of sand itself."
4,"A suit of ^RandomArmor^ with the emblem of a crescent moon prominently displayed on the chest piece. A creature who suffered injury while wearing the armor experiences no dreams of any sort the next time they sleep. They wake undisturbed by the traumatic memories of pain and combat subconscious might have tried to dredge up."
5,"A tower shield whose entire outer face is taken up by the Brightly Coloured holy symbol of a God of ^GoodDomains^. The interior of the shield bears a large inscription that reads “The Wall Against Which Darkness Breaks” that can be easily read by the wielder no matter how the shield is held."

7,"A steel breastplate emblazoned with a coat-of-arms; A stylized golden windmill on a red field."
8,"A rare set of Dwarven plate armor, created from thin sheets of a specially treated stone that resemble marble. This specific suit of Dwarven stone armor is cumbersome and more ornamental than practical, the whorls in its marbled texture area pleasing to the eye. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that this design of stone armor serves as the dress uniform for the legendary dwarven defenders. Nevertheless, the armor provides impressive protection, as long as the person wearing it does not plan on moving very fast. Dwarven stone armor includes greaves and helmet, but not gauntlets."

10,"A hulking suit of plate mail with overall grim physical traits. The upper arms and legs are comprised out of several long, silver-colored iron plates, while the lower arms are made out of a pair of two plates tied together. The hands are a pair of iron gauntlets, each having a pair of four spikes instead of knuckles and fingers made of cloth.

The chest piece is formed out of two large metal plates held together by an iron ring, in turn, held in place by five leather belts. Around the waist and left shoulder, the armor sports a brown tunic with fur trims, which is tied together by a black leather belt with two dangling rings of iron. The neck is an extension of the torso plates, in turn, covered by an iron guard formed from a single, long iron plate that forms a circle around the sides and the back of the head. The helmet is a composite of iron, facial bones and fur. The nape and the scalp are two distinct metal plates, with a pair of small horns just above the eye sockets, the number “66” written on the left side, just above the cheekbone, and the white long hair protruding from the back. The face is formed out of white facial bones of some unknown humanoid animal, having large eye sockets, a large mandible with two spiky bone going downwards and eight distinct razor-sharp fangs, four on the upper jaw and another four for the lower jaw. A small alchemical circle drawn in blood is located inside the armor, written on the neck plate."
11,"A set of half-plate armor assembled from a combination of chainmail with metal plates (breastplate, epaulettes, elbow guards, gauntlets, tasses, and greaves) covering vital areas.

12,"A large leather shield made of glossy blue lizard skin stretched on fir, bearing a flaming hand of white on a dark green field.

15,"An exquisite armor of fire blackened chainmail, adorned with the blue-black feathers of ravens."
16,"A close close-fitting bodysuit resembling sharkskin. Multitudes of overlapping tooth-like, artificial scales cover the body from the neck down.

However the bearer must spend as much time donning the bodysuit as he would donning a set of plate mail."
17,"A tower shield of brass and mahogany displaying the image of a lute within a square in grey on a black field."
18,"A set of druid tooled, studded leather armor fitted with pieces of amber, bone, wood, shell and jade rather than metal."

22,"A shield with two metal sticks that can be taken out of the back. When hit, the shield either sound like a steel drum, a gong, or an odd snare drum, depending on where on the shield it is struck. When not in combat, the armor serves as an odd but perfectly functional drum."
23,"A set of studded leather that not only offers solid core protection but also a bit of extra defense in the form of two defensive shoulder pieces allowing the wielder to shrug off blows with ease.

25,"A full suit of plate constructed from the shells of giant scorpions. The predatory arachnid's chitin is heavily polished and the inner surfaces are fitted with padding, rendering it flexible and rather comfortable to wear.

The armor includes a pair of lobstered gauntlets fashioned from a pair of the hulking scorpion's claw's making the wielder truly terrifying to behold."
26,"A full set of plate armor that encases the bearer in a suit of interlocking steel plates, designed for maximum protection.

The strips are arranged horizontally on the body, overlapping downwards, and they surrounded the torso in two halves, being fastened at the front and back. The upper body and shoulders are protected by additional strips (shoulder guards) and breast and back plates. This design allows it to be stored compactly since it can be separated into four sections, allowing for easy travel when not being worn, which is perfect for long distance military campaigns."

The helm consists of a large spike, like a rhinoceros, with many jagged edges along the side and the back.

The same for the thighs and legs, and even boots which are also heavily spiked."
33,"A well-waxed shield fashioned from the shell of a violent species of ferocious snapping turtle."

36,"A full sleeved hauberk (Chainmail statistics) of interlocked rings of metal to creating a protective yet flexible coat for warriors headed into battle. Each link of steep loops into four other separate rings tremendously reinforcing each one's ability to stop a weapon's blow. The chainmail is designed in an alternating method makes use of both riveted and solid flat rings to create an armor that is truly impressive, both in style and in terms of the protection it offers."
37,"A small steel shield, triangular, emblazoned with a griffon device in red on a field of grey. The battered shield is inscribed on the interior with the words: “May this shield be your protection in battle, Jallak. Honor the Galbrand name.”"
38,"A suit of steel scale mail enriched by colourful decorations that have been acid etched into the metal. Each individual enameled scale of the armor has been adorned with the image of part of a continuous flowing story, allowing a viewer to follow the scales around and down the wielder's body like a patchwork quilt telling a tale."
39,"A large, round, slate grey shield. It has a completely matte texture and light seems to slide right off of it around the rim."
40,"A suit of half plate armor beaten in designs of highly stylized faces inlaid with gold to highlight their expressions. Each half of the breastplate is a glowering, howling demonic face while the plate the protects the guts is a bas relief of a beatific, androgynous human face. The shoulders, helmet, and other pieces of armor are likewise decorated. When a creature puts on the armor, they feel and hear barely audible whispers, as if the faces on the armor speaks to them. The words are encouraging and uplifting."
41,"A tower shield fashioned from the top plate of the shell of a Tortle (Or whatever intelligent, giant turtle-man species fits your setting) fitted with brass handles on the interior. Although on first glance the use of the shell of an intelligent creature would be in incredibly poor taste as a piece of armor, a perceptive PC can find that inside the shield's rim the following words engraved: “In loving memory of an unsung hero. May he continue his dream of protecting the innocent.”"
42,"A heavy, leather vest (Studded leather statistics) run through with tiny slivers of iron, which give the armor a dull sparkle."

56,"A large reddish grey shield etched with a depiction of a gaping maw filled with teeth."

This armor is light enough to be worn for prolonged periods, and doesn't significantly impede mobility, making it ideal for use by those who rely on their natural reflexes in combat. It does nothing to protect the limbs or abdomen, however, and while it resembles a heavy trench coat it is still quite obviously armor."
58,"An ornate golden shield with intricate ancient arcane runes written in a long forgotten language along its border."
59,"A beautifully detailed set of ring mail armor. The sigil of a gold hammer on the outline of a shield, dominates the chest piece. The armor looks in good repair."

80,"A suit of armor composed of great plates of black metal. The various pieces are studded and bolted, beaten and pointed, spiked and hammered together in a mass or twisted metal.

The plate armor is topped with a protective mask of scarred black iron."

100,"Shield of False Sorcery: A rune etched shield that has enchanted with an overwhelming magical aura of abjuration and protection. Apart from this, the shield is entirely plain in every way and can be damaged as though it were a non-magical shield. When closely examined by a creature skilled in arcane matters it can be determined that the protective aura is nothing more than a convincing illusion which offers no protection whatsoever. It is not readily apparent why someone would go through a fair bit of trouble to create a counterfeit magic shield."
