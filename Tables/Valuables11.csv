1,"A simple sledgehammer, perfectly balanced and crafted from solid adamantine. Painted along the shaft are the words “UNIVERSAL KEY”. When the bearer uses it to attack a door, wall container or other object, it is twice as effective as a typical sledgehammer and can break through any material that isn't adamantine. As an action equivalent to attacking, the wielder can shatter, smash, sunder or otherwise damage a non-adamantine object a number of square inches in size equal to his strength score (Minimum one). It's weighted poorly for fighting and is no more functional than an improvised club in combat."
2,"A statue depicting an owlbear roaring in triumph that's roughly the size of a halfling. The statue is carved from dark green jade, flecked with specks of red."
3,"A lavender blue translucent stone with the white rays of a tiny star lurking in its heart. A thin patina of dust lies on the surface of the gem which is set in the corroded steel pommel of a rapier. The weapon's blade and quillons have rusted away. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gem as star sapphire."
4,"A ^RandomMusicalInstruments^ of masterwork quality that when played, produces subtle undertones and quiet reverberations allowing the musician to weave a tune within a tune when playing. This complex music is perfect for carrying emotionally suggestive messages."
5,"A thurible forged of gold and gleaming electrum, that constantly emits a pleasant-smelling mist."
6,"A cylindrical, iron device used to crush rock into fine gravel and dust, which can be more easily tested for the presence of precious metals or gemstones. The pulverizer is roughly one foot in diameter and height, with a flip-top lid and a crank handle. After stones are placed into the device and the lid clamped into place, the handle is turned. This rotates a number of grinding wheels inside the pulverizer, using gears to maximize the available force, crushing the rocks thoroughly. The gears are coated in a thin layer of adamantine allowing them to pulverize anything weaker than adamantine. A pound of rocks, minerals, metals, gemstones or even diamonds can be ground to a gritty powder in one minute."
7,"A ceramic poker chip worth 500 gold pieces issued by Behemoth Casino, with the eyes of the image of Behemoth scratched out."
8,"A set of priestly vestments of gold and silver thread decorated with azurite and moss agate stones."
9,"A coinsmith's toolkit containing all the tools necessary for a person to smelt, cast, mint and stamp the coins of the local kingdom. The availability of these tools is severely restricted, with only those sanctioned by the governing body being permitted to use it legally. A Knowledgeable PC would be able to determine that the mint and stamps are about a decade old, making them still useful to forgers and unlikely to be missed by whichever treasury official was responsible for it."
10,"A gold ewer in the shape of a manticore with its tail as the handle."
11,"A delicate-looking, spiraled silver trumpet inlaid with intricate Elven script, which translates as “giving succor” and “friends shall answer the call.” The mouthpiece is of pale ivory and an emerald-studded, leather baldric allows the horn to be slung over the carrier's shoulder. Any music played on instrument is clear, sweet, and hauntingly beautiful. The horn never tarnishes or shows any sign of wear during regular use, it remains as bright and unsullied as the day it was created. Knowledgeable PC's recognize it the object as an elven scout's horn, albeit an ornate and high quality one. Outriders, rangers, and other advance units of elven armies carry such horns. Used to maintain communication and summon aid over long distances, these instruments are usually simple affairs made of horn or brass."
12,"A false eye with an iridescent iris. If placed into an empty socket it functions as an organic eye that can also see any invisible fairy creatures."
13,"A speckled egg the size of an orc's fist with a nearly impenetrable shell. Even knowledgeable PC's are unable to identify the egg's species of origin or how to care for it. Regardless of how it is cared for, the egg will hatch within 3d20 days of being found and inside will be a hatching one of the following (roll 1d6); (1) a sphinx, (2) a tiny cherubic angel bearing strange prophecies and descriptions of the infinite heavens, (3) a hydra, (4) a cockatrice, (5) a two-headed albino dire crocodile, (6) an evil spirit that reveals the darkest desires and shameful secrets of the person nearest to it."
14,"A glass box containing a small spider, a gnawed human finger-bone, and curious webbing spelling out the words “I always loved you.” When fed humanoid remains, the spider spins elaborate webs spelling out the last words of whoever it consumed."
15,"A silver key with a coiled chameleon for a bow. This key perfectly fits into the next lock into which it is inserted, changing shape, but thereafter only fits that lock."
16,"A grey and ominous-looking nut known as an Anti-Seed. If planted, it begins to kill all plant-life in a slowly-expanding radius, transforming the soil into a barren, lifeless blight. The seed itself blossoms on the ethereal plane into a grotesque, shadowy flower that slowly spreads more of itself, invisible weeds that expand the anti-seed's aura of decay. After being planted, the seed immediately begins despoiling the land and over the course of one year, creates an area with a one mile radius where no plant life with grow under any circumstance and an area twice that size where plants are sickly and only grow half of what they normally would half and produce half as much food. This area expands one mile per year until the Anti-Seed is found and destroyed on the material and ethereal plane."
17,"A pocket watch with a multitude of faces and dials, each tracking the precise time in a different plane. It is powered by an incredibly tiny rift between the material plane and the abyss. If held to the ear one can hear faint whispers of the chaos."
18,"Crawling Curse: A humanoid skull with a strange sigil carved into the forehead. Each night at midnight, the skull vomits forth a swarm of some variety of hostile vermin (See Note). If someone smashes the skull, they will be devoured from the inside-out by flesh-eating insects each midnight (Dealing half their total hitpoints in damage) until they are subjected to curse breaking magic. If the damage the insects deal would bring the cursed victim to zero hitpoints or less, the victim dies and the vermin burst from the corpse. The swarm consumes every single morsel of the body except for the skull on which is carved the same strange sigil as the previous skull, creating a new Crawling Curse. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that The Church of Mordiggia desire this relic and will demand its return if they learn of its existence. —Note: The DM can create any swarm or roll on the following 1d6; 1, Centipedes 2, Spiders 3, Rats, 4, Wasps 5, Bats 6, Poisonous Snakes."
19,"A twitching finger of a troll capped with platinum and hung from a hefty gold chain."
20,"A wedding dress, quite exquisite, which miraculously fits a bride of almost any size.

The dress registers as a cursed object for any creature or item capable of detecting curses."
21,"A golden hairpin set with a garnet surrounded by small shimmering pearls."
22,"A collection of animated toy soldiers, complete with distinct personalities, in a specialized carrying case; they come alive once removed. Their weapons can do no real damage save to one another.

26,"A luxurious and remarkably well-maintained maple wood violin lies inside a dusty, nondescript carrying case with a burgundy velvet lining. It has a fine rosewood bow with dark horsehair. The fingerboard, chin rest, tailpiece and pegs are each made of fine ebony. A gold leaf pattern has been laid onto the wood, worn off by centuries of age. The instrument still has a dark and sonorous low register and a lustrous shining top register."
27,"Neglected Toy: A child's stuffed animal, in poor condition. It's an unnerving and saddening sight, to most and people with a sympathetic streak feel the urge to keep the toy with them and care for it. Creatures within five feet of the toy cannot fall asleep, even by magical means. The animal registers as a cursed object for any creature or item capable of detecting curses."
28,"An intricate mechanical contraption that's little more than a very expensive toy. This little clockwork horse moves if wound up. Common people can't afford mechanical objects this complex, even if they did something productive, and that's without the silver inlay in the finely carved wood. Some noble family would probably pay extra handsomely to have this back, or perhaps brand you a thief for presuming to sell it. Knowledgeable PC's would realize that its easily worth well over a hundred gold pieces in a market town."
29,"A pair of pantaloons made of fine silk with golden threading. There is a slight tear in the hem but it would still fetch nice price to a tailor."
30,"A fine leather tricorne hat featuring a gold band and several pearls which are set into the brim."

32,"A flawless garnet the size of an egg, unmarred by engravings."
33,"A scepter with a large, marble ball on the top, decorated with two crescent moons made from brass. The rubies on its surface glitter in the light.

During the nighttime, the crescent moons gleam with powerful silvery light and the rubies appear like ordinary stones."
34,"A massive golden brooch weighed down by milky pearls."
35,"Inkwell of Endless Ink: A small crystal inkwell that has an endless supply of lustrous high quality but otherwise ordinary black ink. The inkwell has a small mouth (large enough only to accommodate the nib of a quill), so if tipped over, the ink will dribble out slowly but steadily.

37,"A set of 32 loosely matched jade, greenstone, granite, and sandstone figurines approximately 6 to 8 inches tall, along with a strangely twisted hexagonally gridded chess-like game board inlaid with gold wire.

Bolt cutters make poor weapons and it can only serve as a improvised club in combat."

When it is held at arm's length in front of an object, the markings begin flashing and changing their frequency in front of the bearer's eyes until they come to rest at their new measurements. The bearer is then imparted with the precise height and width of the object he is trying to measure, even if it is extremely far away. If the bearer tries to measure any object that is farther away than 10 miles, the markings will never settle, and begin flashing arcane markings the bearer is unable to interpret."
48,"Gloves of Midas Touch: A pair of immaculately clean, white silk gloves, trimmed in gold. While worn, the bearer can choose to cause everything the gloves touch (Up to a total area of five cubic feet in size) changes to look as though it was made out of pure, brightly polished, gold. The bearer can choose to make this change happen gradually, with gold veins slowly spreading across the item, instantaneously, a gradual shifting or color and shine across the entire object or other style shift the bearer chooses. The object reverts back to what it originally looked like the moment the gloves cease touching the object or the bearer chooses to end the effect. Although the bearer must be conscious for this effect to function it does not consume a significant amount of his concentration and he can maintain the gloves powers easily while in combat, or casting a spell. This effect is an illusionary one and does not physically change the material in any way."
49,"A golden belt buckle bearing the visage of a terrifying marine creature."

Items in the neverweather pack cannot get wet, even if the satchel is completely submerged and non-damaging extremes of heat or cold cannot penetrate its insulated construction.

However, if the bearer wears any type of armor or carries more than a light load, these benefits are lost."
62,"A luxurious, full-length robe woven of a rare type of fabric known as Aurasilk. This special thread is obtained from silkworms psychically awakened by use of subtle telepathy, this cloth behaves normally when worn by non-active creatures. When garments of aurasilk are worn by psionic beings, they shift hue and pattern in response to the bearer's mental state.

63,"A slender brass staff adorned with gold rings and a set of three gold wings reaching up at the top, spaced at equal distance from each other.

84,"A fraying hempen bag containing a glistening silvery chalice, delicately crafted and possessing an airy lightness. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the metal as mithril.

Knowledgeable PC's can discern the arcane markings to discover that the vessel is keeping a lesser fiend trapped within it."
