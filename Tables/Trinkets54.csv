From there, go east for 2-3 miles, until you find the patch of quicksand, then go north-east for 1-2 miles and you'll find the hoard guarded by a fearsome beast. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end.

Similar to spearmint, it cleanses other tastes from the mouth and like menthol it chills the throat as it goes down.

They consist of hollowed-out eggshells filled with a pinch of flash powder and a handful of ash. A thin square of paper is placed over the hole in the egg, with shell and paper held fast together by a gum made of sticky, smeared rice. An egg can be thrown accurately up to 30 feet away as a grenade-like weapon and wherever it hits, the black powder explodes in a flash and ash fills the air in a thick cloud. Anyone within a ten foot radius of the point of impact is overcome by the brightness and sooty eyes and is blinded until the end of their next turn. The sooty cloud remains until the start of the wielder's next turn and is too opaque to see through."
