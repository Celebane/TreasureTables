1,"A humanoid skull infested by a parasitic purple plant from an unknown plane. The longer you stare, the more you could swear that the petals sway in response to an unseen wind."
2,"A rolled up prayer rug used to denote a sacred space and is generally used when a specific ritual site cannot be adequately prepared ahead of time. Embroidered with symbolic diagrams praising the concept of ^RandomGodlyDomains^, the prayer rug can be laid down over any space to create a consecrated area for worship and ceremony."
3,"A gnomish cylindrical device known as a gas finder, containing an oil-fed flame, which draws air through a one-way valve on the bottom and expels smoke and fumes through another one-way valve at the top. A strand of waxed hair is strung through the cylinder far enough above the flame to avoid burning under normal conditions. If a dangerously explosive gas enters the gas finder, however, the flame will burn through the hair, causing both valves to slam shut to prevent an explosion. On the other hand, if an asphyxiating gas fouls the air in a tunnel, the flame is extinguished. In either case, the gas finder warns the bearer of potential gas hazards before they can cause any harm. The gas finder also provides light and consumes oil as a bull's-eye lantern."
4,"A leather strap from which dangles a cluster of tiny, transparent glass globes, each filled with a mix of colored powders. A religious symbol for healing or restoration marks each sphere and emits a distinctive, soothing aroma."
5,"A one gallon cask of a rare pink vintage known as Lovewine with heart-shaped bubbles. If drunk, it produces intensely romantic dreams. The hangover is quite rough."
6,"A wood cut relief showing an airship drifting through the sky at sunset."
7,"A wide leather tube with a lid capable of maintaining a waterproof seal. Inside is a rolled up, full-length portrait of a magician in sky-blue robes, a psuedodragon curled around her shoulders."
8,"An intricately carved wooden harp with images inlaid in gold of the rising sun and trails of flames. The instrument courses with magical energy tied to Ortisald, god of music and the sun."
9,"A waterproof case containing all the equipment necessary to create accurate maps of the surrounding terrain, from open grasslands to dank caverns and dungeons. The toolkit includes parchment with pre-drawn gridlines, colored charcoal and a small, wooden ruler."
10,"A courier's satchel containing eight bamboo scroll tubes, each sealed with red wax. If investigated, each tube contains an identical roll of parchment that bears four large, carefully painted symbols. The ink sparkles in the light, and close inspection reveals it contains finely crushed jade."
11,"A blue silk djellaba, embroidered with floral patterns in silver thread."
12,"A brass ale mug with crude gold filigree."
13,"A collection of steel poles, heavy leather and folding cross-supports that assembles into a collapsing cart. The vehicle can hold up to 200 pounds in its deep pouch, suspending the weight over a single, reinforced-metal wheel. Using a collapsible cart reduces the weight within it by three-quarters, letting someone pushing or pulling it to move a great deal more than their strength would normally allow. When not in use, a collapsing cart folds down and fits easily into a backpack and weighs only 20 pounds."
14,"A brightly colored, checkered smoking vest which reeks of burnt tobacco."
15,"A broad-bottomed green glass bottle with a hemp bottle basket tightly woven about its base. It contains an exceptionally fine elven red wine."
16,"A cedar bowl adorned with gold leaf floral patterns and lacquered."
17,"A black ceramic vase decorated with pastoral scenes in gold leaf."
18,"A crude map of the local area inscribed on a tattered canvas scroll, that bears an “X” marking an area near where the map was found. There is a list of instructions in the bottom corner of the map: Find the old fort, then go north-west for 1-2 miles until you find a landslide of shale and gravel. From there, go north for 3-4 miles, until you find the abandoned campgrounds, then go south-east for 3-4 miles and you'll find the wealth protected by magical wards. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end. The map could easily be a prank, trap, confidence scheme, ambush or the area could already have been stripped of any value by other adventurers."
19,"A cylindrical iron rod about two feet in length. Arcane sigils inlaid in electrum spiral around it from top to bottom. It can be used as a spellcasting focus for arcane magic."
20,"A decorative hanging lamp made from red glass and bronze."
21,"A devilish mask depicting three faces, each with a different expression: one of horror, one of joy, and one of anger. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that the same style of mask is worn by to Prospero, the Marquis di Maschera, a cambion prince of the Nine Hells."
22,"A decorative ivory hair pin with blue-green turquoise set in the head."
23,"A one gallon cask of Burrfoot's Nut Brown Ale. This full-bodied ale is based on a recipe first attributed to Nedelmeier Burrfoot, a Halfling brewmaster of great renown. Burrfoot's nut brown ale has long been used as a social lubricant among both Halflings and taller races. “Burrfoot's,” as it is commonly referred to, is different from standard tavern-fare, as in addition to the regular effects of alcohol, it also produces a mild euphoria in its drinkers. This quality is attributed to the secret recipe that Nedelmeier's descendants still follow faithfully to this day.  Halflings claim that a flagon of Burrfoot's will mellow even the most taciturn dwarf, so long as he keeps drinking. Although the qualities of burrfoot's are not as miraculous as its proponents claim, more than one argument has been settled over a flagon or two."
24,"A diamond-shaped gold coin, with a turban-wearing caliph on one side and pair of palm trees on the other."
25,"A fingernail-sized translucent, dark green gem that's brightly polished and shines in the light."
26,"A foot-tall bronze statue of a four armed, scimitar-wielding, oni."
27,"A four-section wooden rack with cunningly hidden hinges connecting each piece. This spice rack holds six glass spice bottles per reinforced section and folds closed to protect its contents behind sliding plates of tin. A simple brass button lock keeps the entirety from opening accidentally during travel. Each of the bottles is about half filled with common cooking herbs and spices but a PC proficient in herbalism or poisons will notice upon close inspection that the glass labelled “Powdered Horseradish Root” actually contains powdered foxglove root. The Foxglove powder is spicy and bitter and its taste could be hidden in many types of food, but those who consume a modest amount of the powder will suffer extreme heart arrhythmia and die within a few hours of congestive heart failure."
28,"A four-inch diameter, brass disc worked with a fiery sun in shades of gold."
29,"A funeral shroud, of pure white linen fringed and shot through with silver threads."
30,"An elegantly-tailed double-breasted waistcoat, made of a fine dark blue felt, sizes itself to fit tightly to its bearer. Its three pockets each contain a handful of dust and each pocket refills daily at dusk."
31,"A gleaming, translucent, chocolate brown stone that has been cut to the shape of a small faceted square. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as onyx."
32,"A grey leather tube containing a rolled up painting depicting a gore covered demon standing proudly in heaven."
33,"A headless doll that comes with a sack of attachable heads, including one with its eyes and mouth stitched shut."
34,"A hydration suit that is a masterpiece of water retention. Crafted by waste-dwellers with technical skill and unusual materials. Its design allows the bearer to recover nearly all the water his body loses through sweat and exhalation. A hydration suit is made of the skin and tissue of various desert-dwelling beasts and treated with oils or waxes for water retention. It covers the bearer's entire body, with a tight-fitting hood over the head and a mask covering the mouth and nose. Inside the mask is a glass plate to collect condensation and a tube fashioned from watertight materials. An inner lining wicks sweat away from the body and collects it in spongelike filtration material that can be removed after doffing the hydration suit. The tube from the facemask twists in loops around the body, through the sponge, to reclaim moisture, condensing it in a reservoir from which the bearer can sip. A functioning hydration suit eliminates the need to make Constitution checks to avoid dehydration and its mask functions as a filter mask against environmental particulates."
35,"A large multicolored carpet woven with intricate scenes of life in the cities of the south."
36,"A large silk tapestry depicting a fox and a stork sitting down to dinner."
37,"A jasper bloodstone about 3 inches in length set into a silver setting, hanging from a silver chain. Shaped like a teardrop, it is flecked throughout with scarlet, which is where it got its name. A sense of evil flows from this green and red stone that is almost tangible to its bearer."
38,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of a bountiful orchard whose trees are overflowing with fruit, the ripest of which has fallen and filled a cornucopia. The container is brimming with dozens of well-preserved dried currants."
39,"A large wooden instrument with some brasswork known as a dulcian. It's just over two feet long and as large around as a man's arm. It is played by blowing through a mouthpiece pipe which is a thin brass tube. The dulcian produces deep bass tones."
40,"A large triangular gem as blue as ocean surf and has an inner radiance. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gemstone as blue topaz."
41,"A leather wallet stamped with the symbol of a jeweler's loupe and a rock hammer underneath of a worked gemstone. It contains a set of certified identification papers denoting that the bearer is a member of the jewelers and gemcutters guild. The section containing the member's physical description (Height, weight, sex, race, eye, skin and hair color) is completely blank and could be filled in by anyone with half decent handwriting."
42,"A mineral shaped and smoothed like a river stone, and barely small enough to fit in the palm of a man's hand. Narrow bands of pale rose pink irregularly stripe the deeper, more dramatic red of this stone. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gem as rhodochrosite."
43,"A mirrored jar filled with the first beams of light, retrieved “fresh” from the edge of the ever-expanding universe."
44,"A bloodstained and water-spotted leather tube containing a 60 foot long scroll of fine linen gessoed in a mixture of chalk and the ground bones of an angel (At least according to the first foot of the scroll, which contains an introduction in a stodgy and dated dialect of Common, Undercommon, and what appears to be Ancient Jistkan). The rest of the text is a mish-mash of glyphs in Infernal and Abyssal, containing many, many, many terrible jokes from the nine hells, as well as a legalistic and confounding diagram on every 9th foot of the scroll. Although the scroll doesn't say to, if one reads a specific numbered glyph from each jape according to the diagrams, one can construct over 111,111,111 jokes, japes, and jibes as confoundingly funny as the ones before it, although doing so may profoundly affect one's sanity after prolonged use."
45,"A one gallon cask of Will-o-the-Whiskey, a fey brew with minor hallucinatory effects. It starts with a tiny tingling light in the corner of your eyes, ends with a shining orb of light dancing a few yards away from you, moving away as you try to catch it."
46,"A padded box containing a set of four crystal wineglasses with pewter stems resembling curling dragon's tails."
47,"A painting in a gilded frame depicting a giant's castle in the clouds under attack from a flight of dragons."
48,"A pair of epaulets made of dozens of tiny feathers sewn together on a leather backing. The feathers are iridescent black, blue, and green, and are fashioned to look like small, sweeping wings."
49,"A pair of translucent black glass spheres the size of hen's egg. They weigh heavily in the hand and a knowledgeable PC can identify the stones as obsidian."
50,"A pair of worn and faded black and red diamond jester's tights."
51,"A palm-sized, egg-shaped flask of carnelian, its matching stopper sealed with wax. It still contains a poppy-based tincture."
52,"A pentagonal coin of pinkish bronze orichalcum, with a stern-looking dwarven king on one side and a mine entrance on the other."
53,"A puppet made from cotton, wood and tin representing a king or prince."
54,"A rag intended to be wrapped around the scabbard of a sword. It magically whisks away blood and other liquids from a sword as it is sheathed."
55,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ scabbard adorned with semiprecious stones."
56,"A red coat that makes you feel colder when it is worn."
57,"A reedy metal whistle that emits a sound that, while inaudible to most humanoids, can be clearly heard by canines."
58,"A rich brown stone with golden undertones has been worked to depict a round, grotesquely smiling face with flat, angular features. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as tiger's eye."
59,"A leather wallet containing a promissory note from Lord Locher of Wolverton to the bearer, signed and stamped with his seal in wax. It seems deliberately worded so that the payment and the bearer themselves is left unspecified."
60,"A rod that warm to the touch and covered in living human skin. Along the object's length, eyes of all colors stare endlessly. Between the eyes are mouths of all shapes, silently closed. At either end of the rod hang short squid-like tentacles that randomly elongate and shrink."
61,"A rusty iron sphere that glows with infernal runes. The sphere has a small engraving of a human face, mouth agape in a mixture of pain and pleasure. The bandings on this sphere carry the Infernal runes “Bondage, Domination, Captivity.”"
62,"A one gallon cask of Whispy Sour, a specialty alcoholic beverage that when consumed, causes the drinker to float harmlessly a few inches off the floor. The liquor is smooth, sweet and has a slight aftertaste of ash."
63,"A scarab-shaped sealstone in peridot, the size of a coin. The underside of the scarab is inscribed with the insignia of the old empire, and the seal is pierced for stringing on a thread."
64,"A scroll tube of polished bone, its entire surface incised with crowded glyphs picked out with cinnabar. The tube's cap is of serpentine set in copper."
65,"A set of alchemist's supplies that includes two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients, including salt, powdered iron and purified water. The equipment all packs together tightly between layers of quilted linen which protects it from breaking during travels."
66,"A silver ankle chain hung with a dozen tiny silver “charms”, depicting fearsome monsters such as a hydra, a manticore and a basilisk."
67,"A leather wallet stamped with the symbol of a hammer and tongs crossing each other over an anvil. It contains a full set of certified identification papers denoting that the bearer is a member of the blacksmiths and metalworkers guild. The section containing the member's physical description (Height, weight, sex, race, eye, skin and hair color) is completely blank and could be filled in by anyone with half decent handwriting."
68,"A silver hip flask engraved with drunken satyrs chasing nymphs."
69,"A silver horseshoe that shows signs of wear. It was obviously thrown from the hoof of a very wealthy royal. Who else could afford a hundred silver pieces per shoe plus the cost of forging?"
70,"A silver-bladed earspoon with lion's tail tassels hanging beneath the blade."
71,"A simple bracelet composed of two silver bands fused together. When put on, it adjusts its size to fit snugly and comfortably around the bearer's wrist."
72,"A simple round copper coin printed with the same smirking face on both sides, with the monetary value listed as zero. Under careful inspection the smirking face on one side seems to shift as if there were more than one face on it."
73,"A small iron case containing a pair of soft wax plates and 1d4+2 packets of fast-hardening clay. Instructions are stamped into the iron case and to use a clay and wax box, a key is placed between the plates and the case is closed. When opened again, an imprint of both sides of the key remains behind. When a packet of clay is poured through a small hole in one side of the case, a false key is created. This clay key is crude, fragile and only usable once, but works just as well as the original key. The process of making the key takes one minute in total and does not require any sort of proficiency or training."
74,"A simple, battered steel flask containing enough lamp oil to fill a lantern."
75,"A sinister full-face mask of quilted linen that seems to scowl and sneer at the same time."
76,"A sledgehammer made entirely of solid feldspar. When swung, it trails light drifts of sand."
77,"A small suede drawstring that is being shared by a pair of cubic dice exactingly carved from transparent burnt umber stones. The dices' pips are rendered in perfect squares cut with painstaking attention to detail; the surfaces polished and edges smoothed so that they rest comfortably in the hand. Knowledgeable PC's can identity them as jasper."
78,"A small tapestry featuring a hilly landscape with a lone rider on a central crest."
79,"A small, focusing lens of clear crystal. The expensive monocle enlarges and clarifies whatever is viewed through its curved surface"
80,"A smooth tiger eye pin carved with a bony hand reaching into the sky. A thick red oil seeps from the nib-like tip."
81,"A steel rod some thirty inches in length, capped by translucent purple quartz."
82,"A stone tablet marked with runes and carved with a map to the tomb of the dwarven king Odvin Hammerschlag."
83,"A sturdy length of bone, studded with human teeth. It appears to have been carved from a human femur, and the teeth are sunk into the bone root-first. Strange runes and whorls are carved into the rod, and inix leather provides its grip."
84,"A tea ball of tin wire mesh trapping five small, cream-colored pearls with an oily metallic sheen."
85,"A thin, flat box of bloodwood, lined with linen and slotted with thin compartments. It contains a set of bloodletting instruments in blued steel mounted in silver."
86,"A tiny cut stone the hue of pigeon's blood glints and glimmers as its facets catch the light; when backlit its clarity is unmistakable. Knowledgeable PC's can identity it as ruby."
87,"A wash-leather script containing a stack of a dozen or so folded pages bound with waxed twine. In faded script, the words “My dearest love, Lisandria” adorns the topmost letter of the bundle. If read, all of the pages are comprised of love letters."
88,"A white ceramic pot containing a green ointment smelling of damp limestone."
89,"A wooden box containing a dozen candles made of ^RandomColourTable^ wax. Each of the candles has an alchemical starter mixed in with the wick. By twisting the wick sharply, it is possible to light the candle without the application of fire. A self-lighting candle is in every other way a normal candle. Each candle will burn for one hour."
90,"A wide portrait depicting a battle of epic proportions between two ancient red dragons against a tarrasque."
91,"A wooden crate containing a large amount of straw padding, that's protecting a complex piece of glassware useful for alchemists. Known as an alembic, it can handle several mundane boiling and separating tasks automatically, allowing the user to concentrate on other, more important processes."
92,"An extremely well-wrought pale wooden kazoo, with a small clear crystal set into the top of it. When it is lifted to the lips, the crystal rises and hovers, spinning slowly, just above the kazoo."
93,"A wooden travel case containing ##3d4+2## rations known as Halfling Bread. During their long nomadic wanderings the halflings perfected a baking method that allowed them to create highly nutritious, light rations that resemble small, brown rocks. Well traveled PC's know that Halflings simply smile when asked how they make the things, filled as they are with exotic dried fruits and a variety of meats that should go bad in days but somehow stay good for months. Each loaf is a full day's worth of meals in itself and properly cared for, a ration of halfling bread stays fresh for several months."
94,"A worked gem colored a deep sea foam green, cut into a roughly square shape. Knowledgeable PC's can identify it as malachite."
95,"An alabaster bust of Queen Meritamon of the desert kingdom of Khemet."
96,"An elegant silver mask that evokes the feeling of an angelic presence within those that gaze upon its wearer. This mask does not have a strap, instead simply adhering directly to the face of whoever wears it, though it can be removed without issue."
97,"An ivory and ebony serving tray, carved with elephants and tigers, decorated with gold leaf."
98,"An ivory figurine of a prancing horse."
99,"An oddly-shaped, three-sided, stringed instrument known as a Trumscheit. The tapering body is four-feet-long, square and flat on its lower end. The instrument is generally played upright, with the flat end serving as a solid base. The trumscheit has only one string and is played using a two-foot-long wooden stick. It produces a hollow drumming sound, which is where its name originates."
100,"An anklet composed of six identical polished white quartz crystals joined by thin silver links. When worn, the crystals spin slowly around the ankle, catching and reflecting the light in an eye-pleasing way."
