1,"A well crafted ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ bearing distinctive ornamentation of impressive design. Whenever the weapon is grasped, the words “^AllMottos^” flow into the bearer's mind as if long forgotten but suddenly remembered."
2,"A beautiful gemstone sickle made of black opal. Staring deep into the weapon inspires feeling of staring at a spider's web made of strands of glass. It's grip is fashioned out of grey leather wraps from an unknown beast."
3,"A longspear with a half-moon shaped blade which makes it ideal for dismounting attackers. The weapon deals slashing damage and whenever the wielder successfully attacks a mounted target, instead of rolling for damage, he can choose to deal the minimum result possible on his damage roll (I.E., a 1 on a d8) and immediately attempt make a grapple check with advantage against the target. If the wielder is successful the target is pulled from his mount and is unseated. To use the longspear in this fashion, the wielder must be proficient with longspears, glaives and halberds."
4,"A steel morningstar, the spiked head of which is fashioned to resemble the face of demon screaming upward. When wielded in battle, it emits a high-pitched sound that is inaudible to humanoids but disturbing to animals that have acute hearing."
5,"A long, gnarled quarterstaff that looks like several bones fused together and encased in desiccated, grey skin. It appears as if grown from living flesh and bone, then mummified. At the top of the staff, a clump of sinew clasps a spherical object. When the weapon touches fresh blood, the sinew folds back revealing the petrified eyeball of some  mammoth beast. This bloodshot eye is larger than a grown man's fist. Its vivid green iris suggests strange depths, and is unnerving to look at for too long."
6,"A stone sickle, featuring a grotesque handle carved in the shape of a tentacled monkey-abomination."
7,"A battle-hardened polearm with an exaggerated spike at its bottom end to pierce enemies in combination attacks. The halberd has chinks and minor flaws indicative of being involved in many fights but the blade and spike are made of masterwork steel with intricate decorative lacing."
8,"A deep leather quiver containing ##2d4+2## javelins, each with thin, straight wooden poles surmounted by steel heads patterned with labyrinthine twists of narrow bands of light and dark metal."
9,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ bearing the holy symbol of a minor deity of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ . When this weapon deals a killing blow, it sings a short prayer in Celestial or Infernal. This phrase describes the final resting place of the deceased creature's soul."
10,"Dust Knuckles: A pair of fingerless leather glove that include four small pouches along the knuckle lines into which tiny glass vials can be inserted. The bearer can use vials filled with poison, ground glass, dried wolf's-bane, powdered silver, acid, holy water or any other material. When the wielder successfully punches a target (An unarmed strike), the vials shatter, releasing the contents into the target's face and eyes. When broken, the tiny vials deal slashing damage equivalent to a dagger (1d4) and the effects of the contents in addition to the punch's damage. Vials of ground glass deal an additional dagger's worth of slashing damage(1d4), while powdered silver deals an additional dagger's worth of damage to creature's vulnerable to silver and converts all of the damage done with the unarmed strike to silver damage for overcoming damage resistance. It takes one standard sized vial of acid, holy water, poison, etc to fill up the four smaller ones. A successful attack with the Dust Knuckles full of acid, holy water or poison are treated as if the target had been doused or injected with the respective contents. The cost of four tiny vials that can fit within the knuckle pockets cost as much as one standard sized glass vial but may not be available everywhere. As the gloves are not metal plated or spike studded, they are not immediately recognizable as weapons and observers suffer disadvantage on all checks made to notice the knuckle pockets and the bearer gains advantage on checks made to conceal them as mundane gloves. Whenever the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the Dust Knuckles, there is a 25% chance that he suffers the damaging effects of the broken vials as well as their contents. After being used, clearing the broken glass out of the knuckle pockets and loading and properly securing new vials requires a full minute per glove."
11,"A battleaxe on a stone handle with lightning designs racing up along its length. It has a black iron head, the wavy edge vaguely resembling a cloud. Silver bands connect the blade of the axe to the handle."
12,"A beautiful rapier with an elaborate red hilt and an unusually long blade. The blade's metal seems to shimmer with different colors in the light."
13,"A broad bladed assassin's dagger designed to inflict vicious, gaping wounds that are difficult to mend."
14,"A broadsword (longsword statistics) made in the classical antiquity fashion and fitted with an elaborate basket hilt."
15,"A bulky, heavy repeating crossbow whose mechanism is crafted of hammered steel with a sizable crank. Gold filigree runs down the length of bow, and the string is of sturdy copper wire."
16,"A club, made from the tusk of a great sea beast, which belonged to a nomadic chieftain whose name is now lost to time."
17,"A composite longbow sporting a smooth finish over its graceful woodgrain surface that grants the weapon an attractive quality, though the marks of hard use upon it attest more to its practical utility than beauty of design."
18,"A cutlass with a short, heavy slightly curved blade useful for both stabbing and slashing. Its heavy basket protects the wielder's hand from injury and disarming maneuvers."
19,"A dagger consisting of two blades mounted together upon a central hilt. The double-bladed weapon is lethal in the hands of a skilled wielder who can constantly whirl the blades around to confuse opponents before striking with lethal force."
20,"A dark steel glaive. The shaft is covered in roses with eye in each one. On the bottom is a woman's face frozen in a scream."
21,"A deceptively simple, knotted staff of stout oak. Unpolished and rough, the wood looks freshly cut from the bough of an ancient tree. The staff is thick and sturdy, ideally suited for use either as a walking stick or a quarterstaff. Nature's power surges through the wood, causing plants within five feet to open their flowers and bend toward the staff as if it were the sun."
22,"An obsidian dagger longer than a large man's hand, carved to resemble a carnivore's tooth. The glassy black surface has delicate looking lacy white spots along the grain."
23,"A distinctive ^RandomMeleeWeapons^  with the emblem of a crescent moon prominently displayed on the grip. The bearer's dreams are always vivid and memorable and the weapon is always featured in some prominent role in the dreams. Being wielded by the bearer to great effect in pleasant dreams and being lost, stolen or used against the bearer during nightmares."
24,"A gnarled longbow, colored the awful, unsettling white of polished bone. When grasped, whispers and horrible cracking sounds fills the wielder's head."
25,"A greataxe whose head is shaped to resemble the profile of a yawning wolf, its gaping jaw forming the blade's edge."
26,"A greathammer (Maul statistics) that is little more than a chunk of pig-iron affixed to a splintering haft. This rockhammer would normally be serving a miner in breaking apart and shaping dense rocks and metals."
27,"A halberd plated with gold and silver images of celestials and edged with diamond. When swung, a hymn to a saint of God of ^GoodDomains^ is heard and puffs of white smoke are left in the path of the blade."
28,"A half dozen arrows tied in a bundle with white ribbon, their heads of fine silver and their fletching of trimmed Pegasus feathers."
29,"A halfling made, burlap sack containing ##3d6+3## sling bullets that knowledgeable PC's will recognize as Tumbling Bullets. Each bullet resembles a standard one save for a few tiny holes and vents along the equator. A tiny channel allows air to pass through the bullet when it is fired which causes it to tumble through the air. It's impossible to accurately block the missile's erratic spin. When the wielder launches a Tumbling Bullet, the wielder's attack roll ignores any and all defensive benefits that an opponent's shield would normally provide. A tumbling bullet has an incredible amount of wind drag and can only be fired for half of its normal range increment before suffering accuracy penalties."
30,"A hand-axe that's ornamented but functional. The haft is golden oak, the head a stylized lion's head of bronze with the bright steel blade emerging from the beast's mouth."
31,"A heavy-ended saber known as a tulwar (Scimitar statistics) that is fairly easy to use and extremely functional. However, its down-turned blade (Intended to catch opponents off guard) with a variety of different slash and thrust angles, is mostly theoretic in principle and brings no more advantage to combat than a typical weapon."
32,"A laminated bow made of both yew and hickory. There are small runes in silvered script facing on the back. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that bows such as these are used by wood elf scouts, and the elven glyph for “hunter” is branded into the grip."
33,"A large and brutal double-headed mallet (Greathammer statistics) designed for those who wish no subtlety in their fighting."
34,"A large greatclub that appears to be little more than an oaken branch. The head of the club is split and cracked with age, but it is no less durable despite the passage of time. Two large handholds have been worn into the base of the weapon from repeated use."
35,"A large two-handed mace bearing a head made of stone hewn into the rough shape of a mallet."
36,"A light crossbow and a quiver containing 4d6 bolts, all designed for aquatic combat. The string is constructed from many wrapped twines of waxed sinew, the wood treated and all metal parts made of brass to resist the corrosive effects of constant immersion in seawater. The bolts are fluted and spin slightly in flight, thus enabling the weapon to be used underwater far more effectively than conventional crossbows. When used underwater, the aquatic crossbow does not suffer any penalties to its range increment, though all other penalties for underwater combat still apply. On dry land, this weapon is treated as an ordinary light crossbow."
37,"A light flexible dagger crafted entirely from resin, containing no metal or wooden components."
38,"A lightweight scimitar adorned with a bright golden handle. The blade is patterned with winding snakes."
39,"A light crossbow crafted entirely from metal to make it as strong as possible at the cost of being five pounds heavier than a typical crossbow. A small blade sits beneath the prod, allowing the crossbow to be wielded in melee combat. A bladed crossbow functions as a dagger when wielded as a melee weapon. The wielder incurs no penalty on attack rolls when using the bladed crossbow as a melee weapon."
40,"A lightweight wicker quiver containing ##4d6+3## arrows, all sporting engraved shafts. The distinctive designs along the shaft don't impair flight and knowledgeable PC's can recognize the marks as the personal calling card of a famous (Or infamous) archer."
41,"A composite bow that appears to be made from layers of horn wrapped with glue and sinew, then dyed a deep red."
42,"A longbow whose limbs are made of two different materials. The bottom is a dark brown wood with seemingly faded green etchings of plants and snakes. The top is an ebony wood with faded white etchings of stars and planets. The limbs are oddly flexible when the string is not pulled back."
43,"A longspear with a haft carved from pale ash, with dark veins swirling through it and an iron butt capping the end as a balancing weight. The blade is leaf-shaped, one long, sinuous curve from tip to hilt, unlike the wedge-shaped blades of most spears."
44,"A longsword shaped from a single piece of darkly oiled and gleaming wood. The grain runs with the length of the blade and the wood is vibrant, as if still living. It never needs to be sharpened and the blade is somehow as sharp as steel."
45,"A mace with a short, steel haft with a flanged head that relies on the wielder's brute strength of arm to inflict debilitating crushing injuries."
46,"A majestic, shining rapier, with exceptionally thin grooves going from the hilt to the very tip of the blade. It is forged of a silver alloy and the handle is adorned with elegant flowing lines."
47,"A longsword with colors swirling in dizzying, mad patterns on the strange steel of its blade. The name “Prince Rolan” shines in Sylvan writing on the crossguard of the sword."
48,"A massive executioner sword (Fullblade statistics), rounded at the tip but sharp as steel can be at the edges. Its center is forged of strong black steel with runes carved down the middle of it in thin scrolling text."
49,"A massive greatsword chiseled from a single, incredibly heavy piece of jagged stone. Ancient arcane binding barely prevents it from shattering on impact."
50,"A matched set of shortsword, dagger and two throwing-knives, all cast in one piece from fine steel. The hilts are wrapped with dragonhide and on each tang is engraved the signature of a legendary weaponsmith."
51,"A padded wooden case containing ##3d4+3## specialized crossbow ammunition known as Venom Bolts. More akin to a vial of poison than a typical bolt, each one it tipped with fogged glass containing a virulent toxin. In addition to the crossbow's typical damage, upon impact, the glass shatters releasing a cloud of poisonous vapor in a 10-foot radius sphere around the target. The cloud spreads around corners and lightly obscures the area it occupies. The cloud lingers in the air until the start of the wielder's next turn and, and deals poison damage equivalent to a dagger (1d4) to all creature who are in the area at the time or move into it before it dissipates. The glass heads are brittle and not meant for clumsy hands. A wielder who rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll while shooting the Venom Bolts accidentally shatters the glass head on his gear, the ground at his feet or the crossbow itself which causes the poison cloud to appear centered on the wielder."
52,"A pair of heavy, curved knives with the sharp edge on the inside of the curve, know as kukris. Their blades are made from steel that has been polished to a reflective surface that could be used as mirrors. The daggers never require sharpening, regardless of use and would be excellent for clearing heavy brush."
53,"A quarterstaff consisting of a simple wooden pole with an intricate golden topper that extends into four peaks. A shining blue crystal persistently hovers and rotates between these peaks."
54,"A quiver meant for climbing with a a covered top and a cork-lined base that holds arrows (Or bolts) securely. Extra straps hold the quiver tight against the body, keeping it from swinging free at inopportune moments. When found, the quiver contains 15 sturdy crossbow bolts that can also double as pitons."
55,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade is dented, chipped, and dirty. Its hilt is black with some worn leather grip-straps and a red gemstone in the pommel."
56,"A quarterstaff of light colored maple with a solid central shaft and tightly bound metal ends. The top end has a clear crystal cap, under which the wielder can fit a fuelless light source. This allows the wielder to carry a light source with him without compromising his ability to protect himself. It is possible to use the staff as a weapon without damaging the light source."
57,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with an extraordinarily bright blade, like a polished mirror. The handle is wrought with gold overlay and covered with divine markings."
58,"A quarterstaff that has the appearance of blackened wood and is hard like iron. Adorning its shaft are faint occult marks that flicker between blood red and eldritch green hues. The staff is abhorrent to all good-aligned creatures."
59,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with an exceptionally well-crafted steel blade bearing four runes at the end of its length. These runes represent the wielder's ideals and will painlessly brand themselves into the skin of its true owner."
60,"A rapier whose blade was once dazzling white metal, its platinum hilt fashioned like angelic wings. Now, however, the weapon seems victim to neglect. Its precious metals are tarnished and its point is rusted."
61,"A seemingly-crystalline javelin found tied with a rope of braided black horse hair, resting inside of a sheath made of rough green leather. The javelin is inscribed with fragments of folktales from different cultures, written in Sylvan and Infernal."
62,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with brass fixtures, whose blade is coated in a brittle shell of rough sea salt."
63,"A set of three matched throwing daggers of black iron, each set with a single moonstone in the tang; tang, hilt and blade are forged as one unit."
64,"A sharply curved and razor sharp dagger, claw-like in shape with a delicate golden hilt. The sheath lays next to it, also gold and covered in empty settings show where jewels have been pried from away."
65,"A shortbow with a joint in the middle that allows it to fold in half when unstrung, making it easier to conceal. Assembling or disassembling the bow is an action equivalent to attacking. The bearer gains advantage on any checks made to conceal, disguise or hide the folded bow."
66,"A silver and green shortbow that's lightweight and elegant. The wielder feels an energetic sense of purpose when wielded."
67,"A simple mace made from a short, gnarled piece of bronzewood in the shape of a club."
68,"A simple straightsword (Longsword statistics) made out of a pale, nacreous metal. The edges winnow to a sharpness so fine that you cannot see."
69,"A sinewy crossbow made of the twisted bones of an ancient subterranean aberration. It is always cold to the touch."
70,"A singed oaken quarterstaff with a forked tongue of metal on each end and a hand grip made of padded leather."
71,"A single-edged longsword made from red steel. The sword has a vicious, spiked design and feels as if it were balanced for a wielder that was not quite humanoid. The hilt is curved and wrapped in black leather, ending in a sharp hooked pommel."
72,"A slashing polearm (Glaive statistics) with two broad, parallel sword blades affixed to the end. This war fork can be used for stabbing, or it can be swung like an axe."
73,"A sling made from dark, tightly woven cord and a thick piece of leather etched with runes written in Giant."
74,"A small quiver containing ##3d6+3## arrows, cruel in their design. Each arrowhead is adorned with wickedly sloping sides which hook back towards the shaft to form jagged barbs. On a critical hit, the arrowhead lodges itself deeply into the target, creating a wound which is difficult to treat and which will quickly grow more severe if not removed. When this occurs, at the start of the target's subsequent turns, he suffers an amount of damage equivalent to a dagger (1d4) until a creature forcibly removes the arrowhead with an action equivalent to attacking (Which causes the target 1d4 damage) or a creature proficient in medicine spends an action equivalent to attacking to carefully remove it without further harming the target. These arrows are not recoverable after being shot."
75,"A squat, black warhammer that is sturdy but extremely rudimentary. The angles on the head are hard and crude, a simple leather wrap serves as its grip."
76,"A steel dagger with gold and copper ornamented hilt, the blade inlaid on either side with a tongue of blackened bronze ornamented with silver lilies."
77,"A stiletto type dagger whose thin pointed blade attaches to the hilt by means of two sets of tiny clamps. With the press of a button, the clamps release and the blade comes free of the hilt. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks with the dagger, he can press the button leaving the blade embedded within the victim's body. When this occurs, at the start of the target's subsequent turns, he suffers an amount of damage equivalent to a dagger (1d4) until a creature forcibly removes it with an action equivalent to attacking (Which causes the target 1d4 damage) or a creature proficient in medicine spends an action equivalent to attacking to carefully remove it without further harming the target. Whenever the blade is released this way there is a 25% chance that the small clamps become damaged or the blade is warped, damaging the dagger beyond use. If this dagger is thrown and successfully hits a target, the blade snaps free upon shock of impact, embedding itself in the target as described above but breaking the weapon beyond further use."
78,"A straight bladed machete (Shortsword statistics) crafted from a black alloy that gleams red in the light. It is clearly segmented and a spike juts from the back of each segment. The blade seems to cut through the air and swings with an uncanny speed."
79,"A sturdy quiver containing ##3d6+3## arrows with have long, narrow, metal points instead of the broader heads commonly used with most arrows. This far smaller impact area of the arrow allows it to punch straight through armor with ease."
80,"A sturdy wooden handaxe with a shiny blade that looks like it's brand new."
81,"A twin bladed glaive with a heavy brass handle, forming a spiral pattern with runic engraving all over the shaft. The blades sport embedded rubies and more scrolled engravings. The glaive seems to shine unnaturally bright on the sunlight, as if absorbing solar power to summon powerful magic."
82,"A two-headed spear (Longspear statistics) that's simply a long, wooden haft with a spear-point on each end. A two-headed spear form is a constant blur of motion, the spear spinning in figure-eight patterns as the wielder leaps and twists."
83,"A weapon consisting of a pole with a long curving cleaver blade mounted near the tip. The polearm is known as a bardiche (Halberd statistics) and is cumbersome and unwieldy but devastating when it strikes."
84,"A weapon made up of a spear tip and an axe head mounted on opposite ends of a sturdy pole. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize it as a Dwarven Urgosh, also known as the spear-axe. A wielder who is proficient in both longspears and battleaxes can wield the Urgosh and treat it as a longspear or a battleaxe as desired each time they attack."
85,"A whip, overlaid with five shekels of gold. A large banded agate is inserted into the pommel. A banded agate seal is strung on it."
86,"Piercing Flutegun: An ordinary looking flute that contains a hidden blowgun mechanism. It would take a through physical investigation of the instrument to discover that it is also a weapon. Knowledgeable PC's have heard that this is a favourite weapon of bardic assassins, as it can be used as an instrument and fire a blowdart at the same time. The needles fired by the flutegun and incredibly small and deal no damage on their own but can deliver a potent dose of poison. The flutegun only holds one needle at a time, but can be reloaded while playing. Onlookers must succeed on a perception check against the wielder performance check (Which the wielder has advantage on) to notice that the flute is being fired or reloaded."
87,"A wicker quiver containing ten fishing arrows with small barbed hooks and waterproofed fletchings to allow the wielder to easily catch fish just beneath the surface of water. Each arrow has 50 feet of line attached to its tail, which will support up to 30 pounds in weight."
88,"A wide, black steel dagger that has been stained by the blood of countless sacrifices to the elder gods. No matter the means, it cannot be cleaned."
89,"A wide, flat composite bow built with a mighty recurve. Each end is carved in the shape of a horse's head, holding one end of the string in its mouth."
90,"A wooden case containing four throwing daggers, with a space for a missing fifth dagger (between daggers three and five). They are identical save for a single letter from an old dialect inscribed onto the blades. The missing letter will spell a word, but it is such that it could be one of several words in that old language. Who knows what would happen if the missing dagger were to be returned to its place…"
91,"An elaborately decorated, ceremonial knife known as a katika with a wide, crescent-shaped blade that is mounted perpendicular to the handle. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that the knife is used to represent the severing of physical bonds and mortal connections. Most often a kartika's presence in a ritual is to spill a small amount of the cleric's blood to serve as a focus for the congregation."
92,"An elven made quiver of dried leather-leaf containing ##3d6+3## specially fabricated arrows that knowledgeable PC's will recognize as Serpentstongue Arrows. Elven archers know that arrows aren't especially useful when attacking objects and so developed these. Serpentstongues have sharp edges on the tips and inside the prongs so that a skilled archer can neatly sever a rope or leather strap with a single shot arrow. A Serpentstongue Arrow deals both piercing and slashing damage, and deals double damage against objects. The prongs and cutting edges are made of brittle but razor sharp obsidian which breaks after use and a Serpentstongue Arrow cannot be reused on a hit or miss."
93,"An enormous warhammer forged entirely from black iron. A grinning skull is etched into the surface of the hammer's head. If the warhammer is not used during combat, it cries and moans. When the hammer is brought to bear in battle, reddish fluid seems to seep from the engraved skull's eye sockets."
94,"An excellently balanced heavy pick with a sturdy oaken handle and a curved flat point on which arcane and divine runes have been carved. The runes begin to cycle across the blade if magic scrolls are within ten feet."
95,"An explorer's quarterstaff made of smooth, hardwood with a few metal fixtures on it upon which small objects can be hung or attached. Unlike many staves, it has a single, flat side making it possible to set it down without it rolling off. It has a heavy, metal loop attached near the middle of the staff, just above the handgrip. Furthermore, the staff can bear up to 200 pounds at its center point, allowing it to be used as a brace, leaver, or even anchor without causing a huge amount of concern. Finally, the staff has a slotted foot to which a spike can be attached, to keep footing on icy surfaces."
96,"An extended quiver containing ##3d6+3## arrows that are slightly longer than normal, with a small, aerodynamic head and enlarged fletching for extra stability and accuracy on long shots. The design of these swiftwing arrows double the effective ranges of the bows they are fired from allowing the wielder to hit targets at great distances without penalty."
97,"An iron sickle that smells of honey and ripe fruit."
98,"An undersized shortsword that gleams with a bright, silvery sheen. The grip is wrapped in simple, unadorned cowhide, and the guard is worked into the shape of a pair of wolf heads. Etched into the blade is a stylized moon disc, which magically alters to match the actual phase of the moon. In addition, although the blade is polished to a mirror finish, with a simple act of will the bearer can cause it to cloud to a dull, matte gray."
99,"A padded belt pouch containing ##3d6+3## blowgun darts, tips coated in dried, inert poison and fletched with red, yellow, and green plumes."
100,"Leeching Dagger: A dagger with a long, thin blade and a wider-than-normal handle, which unbalances the weapon enough to make throwing it impossible. At the base of the blade is a hollow 'fang' that runs down into the dagger's handle, which holds a removable, glass vacuum tube. When maximum damage is rolled (4 on a d4), or on a critical hit, the 'fang' pierces the victim and breaks the seal in the tube, extracting a sample of the victim's blood, ichor or other bodily fluids. The vial then reseals itself with a small cork on a hinge, keeping its contents secure. Once retaining a sample, the leeching dagger may not take any further samples until a new vial is installed. Fluid samples can be used to create any number of alchemical or magical creations, making the weapon a must for any travelling mage or alchemist. A character proficient in alchemy can create a vacuum within an existing glass tube or vial and reseal the dagger at a cost of 1d4 gold pieces worth of materials."
