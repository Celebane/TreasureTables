1,"A small green box containing a single round nephrite stone, the size of a shirt button and twice as thick, mounted with a simple metal clasp. The jade is a flawless, vivid, translucent green, edging nearly into blue. It is so well polished that even in the dim light of a candle it seems to glow."
2,"A spool of very fine wire copper wire. Useful for setting trip-wires, rigging up pulleys, and conducting electricity."

4,"A black top hat that, when doffed, causes the sound of applause to echo around the wearer."

It contains a full set of certified identification papers stamped by the office of the king denoting that the bearer is a bounty hunter licensed to track down aberrations, dire beasts and monstrosities that are infesting crown land or private property and turn in proof of their death to a local authority in return for a reasonable reward. The papers offer examples of general rewards in gold, trade goods or local services to be paid out for a list of common creatures. It says that the local mayor or town council can send a bill to the office of the king to be compensated for most of the reward."
6,"A glassy stone appears to have a reddish liquid core. The stone itself is milky translucent, rock solid, and unlike anything natural you've seen."
7,"A leather case containing a scroll decorated with an old family tree, showing the ancestry of a local noble family. If it's accurate (And it looks like it might be) then a whole branch of the family has somehow disappeared since it was written, despite (Or because of) the fact that they should really be the primary heirs to the family's land. It's unknown if there are any surviving members…"
8,"A jute blindfold marked with a stylized eye in the centre."
9,"An intricate clockwork lute with a strange mechanism. The whirring-pieces of this lute echo with surprising warmth. But it should be noted that no amount of automation can improve a rotten performance."
10,"An artificer's ticket that says the bearer can present this receipt and pick up their commissioned magic item that is being enchanted in a nearby city. The writing states that half the work has been paid in advance and according to the date was completed Roll 3d6 days ago. For proper claiming purposes, the ticket has the first sentence of the following description written on it: ^AllMinorMagicItems^"
11,"A faded flag that belonged to a mysterious sea vessel."
12,"A child's flute on which some of the carver's strokes are still visible, though it is well sanded to keep the child from splinters. Short, made from a single piece of cast-off tulipwood, the flute has just three finger holes and a boxy mouthpiece carved to a bowl at the end. It gives every indication of having been knife-crafted on a porch by a doting grandparent."
13,"A small statuette of an athlete wrestling with an ox, on a plaque bearing writing in a language you don't know."
14,"A translucent shell displaying constellations that appear and fade in relation to the tides."
15,"A staff fashioned from what feels like solid iron. The implement has been carefully engraved: designs resembling lightning bolts wrap around the shaft all the way to the top.

22,"A single scorched iron manacle inscribed with an oddly comforting looking language that no one can actually read."
23,"A small linen down-filled pillow."
24,"A small ornate barrel containing a shimmering golden liquid. It seems exceptionally dense, and has the consistency of honey.

Repeated ingestion is not recommended, as the painless burning sensation quickly progresses to a burning sensation, then to actual burning.

38,"An abacus, made of a dense translucent blue crystal, with a white steel plate on the top. All beads are the same dense translucent blue."
39,"A very ordinary-looking arrowhead. Whenever the object is grasped, flashes of someone else's emotionally poignant memories flash in the bearer's mind as if long forgotten but suddenly remembered; You yanked it out of the body of your best friend with an improvised pair of pliers, but it was too late; the wound was already infected, and he died the following day. How can something so small tear such a big hole in the world?"

47,"A halfling-made shirewood gittern, with inlaid quatrefoils of mother-of-pearl."
48,"A stack of cheaply-printed pamphlets full of wild conspiracy theories, each supported by just enough evidence to sound plausible if you're not too well-informed and don't think about them too hard. The materials would be worth something to a political agitator."

63,"A small black stone tablet with one corner broken off. Those possessing the tablet will have terrible nightmares and strange alien dreams."
64,"The Xanthous Ballad: A leather wallet containing several pages of ancient and yellowed parchment is covered in looping handwriting almost too faded to see. Anyone wishing to use this item must be able to speak Deep Speech. This antique scroll appears as gibberish to anyone unable to do so. Those who can speak it, recognize the hastily scrawled lines as sheet music with one day of careful study. The music is chaotic and discordant making it impossible to memorize or copy. Different parts for different instruments seem to be written over each other. Knowledgeable PC's have heard that according to whispered rumors, this piece of music comes from the infamous play “The King In Yellow”."
65,"A small metal spinning top with a single rune etched along its side that dances and blurs as the top spins."
66,"A pair of clear horn-rimmed spectacles appear ordinary until worn. Anyone wearing them can notice faint squiggles that fall across their field of vision and occasionally form themselves into words."
67,"A three inch tall, polished ruby statuette of a winged woman with talons for feet sparkles when exposed to light. The craftsmanship is exquisite and one can practically count the teeth in her manic grin. One thing to note is that despite this amazing attention to detail, they were not able to truly capture the full impact of a harpy's song."

71,"A small, complex metallic and crystalline object changes shape daily."
72,"A large heavy iron key that is filthy but strangely looks as though it was rarely used. Whenever the object is grasped, flashes of someone else's emotionally poignant memories flash in the bearer's mind as if long forgotten but suddenly remembered; This key unlocked the old slave-collar from around your neck. 'Go', she said. 'You're free', she said. But it's never that easy, is it?"

78,"A tiny bag full of small pellets that explode into miniature sparks on impact. These deal no damage but do create a popping noise as they explode."
79,"A translucent crystalline shard, coloured a faint lavender. It tastes unbearably sweet, and makes the holder's hand sticky as they hold it. It can be melted down into a syrup if desired."
80,"A thimble in the shape of a tower, complete with parapets and arrow slits."
81,"A jar of eyeballs that follow you as you move."

Nothing can bring you down and everything seems good and feels wonderful. If you eat one inhuman screaming fills your brain for the next week."
