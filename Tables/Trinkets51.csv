4,"A cup and ball toy. When the player successfully catch the ball in the cup, they feel a momentary surge of pure childlike joy."
5,"A smoky glass bottle, filled with liquid, sealed with wax and labeled “Butterbile 7:84”. The drink is a hard liquor that is not so much served as it is brandished. Coarse and indifferent, it is to your taste, or it is not. The failing is yours if you cannot raise (Or lower) to the challenge of a distiller told not to."
6,"A dark gray silk tie bearing a tiepin in the shape of a tree, working in silver: trunk, branches and deep roots."
7,"A bleached skull of a ^Humanoid^, who in life was a madman touched by the wisdom of the Great Ones. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that some occultists use foci such as these to gain Insight and that making contact with eldritch wisdom is a blessing, for even if it drives one mad, it allows one to serve a grander purpose. For posterity."
8,"A tiny wooden box containing a croquet set sized for pixies or sprites."

31,"A large funerary hand-bell crafted from a glittering blue-black meteoric ore."
32,"A moonsteel scroll tube, etched with protective sigils. The tube cap twists to lock into place."
33,"A knee-length linen tunic so fine as to be nearly sheer, with multicolored embroidered bands at all hems depicting wildlife, flowers and fantastical beasts."

37,"A fine paraffin candle inlaid with a gold-leaf sunburst."
38,"A glass jar shaped like a giant toe that contains a potent moonshine unlike any other and is not for the weak of body. Known as OgreJam Whiskey, it has a crusty sour taste atop an orange thicker base. When the drinker imbibes a one shot (And each shot thereafter) his feet grow one inch larger. After five shots, the drinker grows a very fluffy grey toe fungus. The effects of this wear off an hour after the last shot is consumed."

There is a list of instructions in the bottom corner of the map: Find the old standing circle, then go south for 3-4 miles until you find the steep-sided valley with blue flowers. From there, go east for 2-3 miles, until you find the vandalized statue of a former ruler, then go north-east for 1-2 miles and you'll find the valuables protected by physical traps. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end. The map could easily be a prank, trap, confidence scheme, ambush or the area could already have been stripped of any value by other adventurers."

100,"The Lute of Destiny: A black-enameled lute strung with muscle fibers from a demon's right arm. Notes strummed on the instrument are uncannily loud and mildly distorted. When held, musical inspiration floods the bearer's mind, and when played, a crowd inevitably forms. In reality, the “inspired” songs are incoherent and obnoxious, and the crowd is an illusion visible only to the player."
