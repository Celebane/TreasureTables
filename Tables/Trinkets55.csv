From there, go north for 3-4 miles, until you find the crossroads, then go south-east for 3-4 miles and you'll find the reliquary guarded by monsters. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end. The map could easily be a prank, trap, confidence scheme, ambush or the area could already have been stripped of any value by other adventurers."
