1,"A bronze dagger with twin straight blades each a foot in length. Despite its apparent great age it is still a masterwork of blacksmithing and is capable of slicing through flesh and bone with ease. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize the construction of the knife is identical to that used by a void cult who performed human sacrifice in an attempt to create an otherworldly entity known as the Outsider."
2,"A beautifully crafted compound bow with a fitted handle and a curved staff that tightens smoothly."
3,"A simple, solid-looking longsword with a plain hilt of cold metal scored with faint grooves for a good grip. The blade itself is rather dull but its edge has a cold and frosty glint and a single silver letter shines near the hilt. Despite its unsharpened edges the blade cuts through flesh and metal as if charmed to do so. The weapon never needs sharpening or maintenance and rests in a scabbard of weathered brown leather."
4,"A large heavy crossbow built by ancient dwarven combat engineers. The weapon is powered by a system of clockwork gears and torsion springs. When not in use, it hums almost inaudibly and ticks reassuringly like a steady grandfather clock."
5,"A longsword made of durable steel with a distinctive rippled pattern that never requires sharpening. The weapon feels heavier than it should be, as though it carries the weight of responsibility, duty and honour. The name of the sword is spelled out in raised letters along the grip, causing the wielder's palm to read “Oathkeeper” when held tightly."
6,"A spiky and particularly cruel whip that can collapse into a small disk making it easy to conceal. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize it as a Lamia or Mayhenian Scourge and is the favourite weapon of the empire's secret service agents as a tool of covertness, intimidation and information extraction."
7,"A longsword with a long thin, blade carrying a slight curve, its edge cruel enough to cut silence and make it scream."
8,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that when held, causes the wielder to hear discordant and wild music. While the chaotic rhythms pound in his ears he can see the true shape of the reality around him in all its harshness and dark truths"
9,"A spiked shield made from the horned skull of a great desert dinosaur."
10,"A rapier with a thin, flexible, whiplike blade and a complicated basket hilt. Branded into the leather grip is the motto of a master swordsman; “I Am Fate's Sword. She Wields Me Cruelly.”"
11,"A barbaric axe adorned with a crude markings and a skull. When in the presence of magic, a dark aura expands from the blade, trying to pull the arcane essence into it."
12,"A bastard sword of unearthly beauty with patterns of silver inlay on a black blade. A spindle of green light emanates from an emerald set in the hilt."
13,"A bastard sword with a slight curve, its handle is silvery and woven with very fine wire. The blade is made from a metal which was only found once, in a meteorite. It has a pearl in its pommel, which seems clear except for a small cloud that moves through it. When swung it always moves faster than the wielder intended, making it difficult to control."
14,"A bastard sword with an elaborate hilt, that rests in a matte black, scabbard covered with rows of runic signs and symbols. The blade is pure silver and polished to a pure shine of mirror-like brightness. The sword and sheath are first found in an oblong packet of thickly wrapped sheep's skins fastened with a leather strap."
15,"A battleaxe with a heavy blade that is notched and stained, with sharp, wicked curves. Small holes dot the blade near the handle and when the wielder swings the axe, air whistles through these spaces."
16,"A beautifully decorated scimitar adorned with long red ribbons of silk that seem to move in accordance with the wielder's intentions. This impressive and distracting display makes it easier to strike enemies."
17,"A black lacquered quiver containing two dozen crossbow bolts, all made from a fibrous mineral that shimmers like strands of polished silver. The unidentifiable material gleams and shimmers in the light, radiating all the colours of the rainbow."
18,"A bloodstained longsword set with a blade composed of iron layered with bronze and is inscribed with the name Orckeeper. The hilt is wrapped in dull brown deer leather and ends in a sharp blade where a pommel would normally be."
19,"A blowpipe with an ornate copper viper wrapping around the deep brown oaken pipe."
20,"A braided rope quiver containing 5d8 arrows constructed from palm tree wood, gull feathers and tipped with shark teeth."
21,"A broadsword with a thick, wide blade. The grip has a dark, swirly look to it, giving the aspect of a cosmic void. The crossguard has a hollow centre and a sharp diamond shape with pointed edges that matches its pommel. The rain guard is adorned with jewels that emanate with regality."
22,"A bundle of carefully wrapped silk cloth that contains three skinny darts and a blowgun cleverly disguised as finely carved pipe."
23,"A cestus (Gauntlet statistics) of blackened leather reinforced with strips of dark iron over the fingers and cruel spikes along the back of the hand and forearm."
24,"A curved dagger with a hilt carved in the shape of a three-headed lion. Knowledgeable PC's will know that the lion hilt is the symbol of a wood elf family of high nobility."
25,"A double edged longsword with a jewel encrusted hilt, crafted from a golden alloy."
26,"A dagger made of volcanic glass with an ornate silver embossed ebony handle. It is wicked sharp but fragile if bludgeoned."
27,"A cavalry sword (Scimitar statistics) that's simple, heavy and murderously well-sharpened."
28,"A dagger set with a wavy blade with an ever so slight chromatic sheen to it."
29,"A curved bastard sword with a slight red tint to it. The blade is serrated with cruel barbs. The black-red iron seems to pulse with an unnatural hunger."
30,"A dagger that appears to be made entirely of ice, although it is not cold to the touch and does not melt in hot conditions. Snowflakes appear and disappear in a swirling cloud about the blade. When it is used in combat, the wielder's skin takes on a bluish hue, as if he were suffering from frostbite, he suffers no ill effects from this condition and the colour fades a few minutes after releasing the weapon."
31,"A burlap bundle enwrapping 11 javelins made of elm wood tipped with steel."
32,"A longsword that appears to be carved from stone from afar but upon close inspection is simply raw iron that is pitted and craggy. An ancient Elven crown rune is stamped in gold at the seat of the blade, just above the quillons. Two black rainbow tourmalines are bound at each end of the quillons, while a red one is set into the pommel. When the longsword is used in combat, golden light crackles like lighting up and down the blade."
33,"A decorative leather forearm guard with flowing scrollwork and golden lacing. A paired stiletto (Dagger statistics) that matches the armor's aesthetics is sheathed on the underside of the armguard and is easily concealable."
34,"A driftwood stick with a heavy seaweed rope suspending a heavy block of coral at the end. The object can be wielded as a crude but perfectly serviceable flail."
35,"A fine greatsword bearing a blade of steel with a hilt wrapped in brown leather. The blade has been carbonized with a flat pine green paint to keep it from reflecting light except along the edges. The pommel contains a puny, well cut chrysoberyl. The tapered flat quillons are unremarkable, but the crossbar is stamped with the image of a ring, and a window. The sword rests in a scabbard of beaten silver."
36,"A finely crafted longsword, set with a matte white blade and a hilt of polished silver and gold wire."
37,"A finely ornamented hunting saber (Longsword statistics), perfectly suited for being on some noble's hip as they make a big show of bringing in a deer."
38,"A gnomish contraption that's half defence, half offence. The weapon is a large turtle shell that can be strapped to the wielder's wrist, with a dagger like blade that juts out just longer and wider than the wielder's open hand. The oddly designed spiked shield is particularly useful in cramped tunnels or warrens where swinging a weapon is difficult or outright impossible."
39,"A greatsword that appears to be made of darkness, its shape is a tangible black void, outlined in a crimson streak which is the source of the blade's faint light. It crackles like lightning when drawn, and creates a sharp buzzing sound when swung, like that of an angry bee. Oddly, when the blade strikes a foe, there is no sound from the hit, despite the strength behind it. Visible on the weapon's pommel of the blade is an elven glyph meaning “Magic”."
40,"A greatsword with a long but relatively thing blade. Along both flats of the blade, etched in elven are the words; “My mark is before me, I shall not waver”"
41,"A heavy crossbow with an inlay of polished and engraved staghorn featuring trophies of arms bearing designs similar to the coat of arms of the local nobility."
42,"A greatsword, heavy and broad of blade, sharpened on both edges and coming to a blunt point. The blade is forged of one piece with the hilt from a mottled, tawny-bronze alloy and is shot through with silky black marbling along the length of the blade itself. The weapon possesses a simple grip of brown jasper plaques carved with indentations for curled fingers; its quillons are simple, heavy and swept back slightly, its pommel a heavy bronze ring bearing a tassel of tawny leather braids."
43,"A heavy and hardened olive wood staff engrained with beautiful swirling, natural patterns."
44,"A heavy mace that bears obvious hammer strikes, around which are floral designs."
45,"A lacquered case containing a matching set of dueling rapiers that refuse to deal a killing blow. The individual swords are marked “His” and “Hers” in High Elven."
46,"A lacquered wooden case containing 15 crossbow bolts made from ceramics with a unique spiral design. These partially hollow bolts, fragment upon impact, showering their targets in razor sharp shrapnel and blinding ceramic dust."
47,"A lacquered wooden quiver containing two dozen slender, needle-like arrows designed to pierce cloth and leather armor, leaving deep, puncture wounds."
48,"A large battleaxe of a dark grey metal. Its handle is wrapped with a grimy strip of leather which is stained by the blood of countless creatures."
49,"A large scythe with a fleshy, dark red handle, and a blade made of a large jaw, lined with incisors."
50,"A leather bundle containing 17 crossbow bolts with shafts of ash wood engraved with knotwork and fletching of gray feathers."
51,"A light crossbow carved from lustrous ebony. The main body of the weapon shows a golden engraving of vine tendrils and leaves"
52,"A longsword forged from a single, solid piece of burnished steel, its craftsmanship is clearly elven in nature. The hilt is longer than normal and gently twisted, creating a good gripping surface. The sword is lacking in quillons or crossguard but does sport a distinctive large spherical “eye” placed at the top of the hilt between the blade and the hilt. The carved eye's pupil always faces outward, as if looking at its target, creating an eerie effect for its foes."
53,"A light pick whose head is shaped like an ibis head with glassy black eyes. Painted along the haft are complex hieroglyphs that may speak to the history of the weapon's crafter."
54,"A long handled, dwarven made warhammer with a striking head artfully designed to look like a ram-headed criosphinx."
55,"A long-handled halberd with a narrow, razor- sharp blade and wickedly barbed tip that bears a faintly glowing, sickly green aura. The shaft is wrapped in dried skin peeled from the corpses of zombies. The faint odour of rotting eggs surrounds the wielder in combat."
56,"A long, green steel spiked chain, with every third link bearing a small pair of red, razor sharp blades about a half inch long. A third of the length from either end is a leather-wrapped handle approximately a foot in length. Half foot long blades adorn the ends, themselves attached by six inch handles."
57,"A longsword made of siderite steel, forged by dwarven machine forges, workmanship simple, but elegant. Its full length forty and a half inches, the blade, twenty seven and a quarter. Exquisitely balanced, the weight of the blade is exactly equal to weight of handle. The weight of the whole sword surely below forty ounces."
58,"A longbow crafted from thick wood with carved stone at the tips and handle. The stonework is made of simple but elegant geometric pattern."
59,"A longbow crafted of mahogany with a wingspan of 62 inches. The weapon has a perfectly poised grip, a smooth neck with laminated layers of woven wood, whale bones and tendons. The arch has an incredible lightness and is accurate to perfection. Although not too long, hiding in the composite is entwined a considerable distance of wire. Equipped with a silk-hemp string and velvet accurately stretched over the protruding handles 22 inches, gives the tension precisely 55 pounds of power."
60,"A longspear made of dead wood, tipped with a cruel iron tip. A pair of long ribbons are tied near the top, seemingly made of orange leaves."
61,"A longbow made of dark yew wood with a string obtained from the sinew of a wild bull."
62,"A longsword with a hilt wrapped in ebony with steel rivets. The pommel is of “skullcrusher” shape, allowing its use as a bludgeon in a pinch. There are straight, square quillons at the crossbar, with a large ring protruding from one of the blade sides. Its scabbard is of coyote fur with oiled brown pigskin accents and steel trim."
63,"A massive greataxe with a dark, obsidian blade and a handle of ivory that is six feet long. The axe head is held to the shaft by golden cord. The haft is covered with intricately carved images of the gods. Among the images displayed are Stronmaus smashing moons with his hammer, Hiatea slaying a 50-headed hydra with her flaming spear, and Iallanis joining the hands of Memnor and Karontor together."
64,"A longsword with a simple grip made of olive wood and a brilliant bronze blade inlaid with electrum. Its curved guard resembles an ancient harp."
65,"A particularly large and obtuse maul with a slightly curved spike on one end."
66,"A perfectly functional ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that's slightly damp to the touch. Any cloth or leather parts of the weapon are replaced by lustrous fish scales and metal portions are instead crafted from seashells and worked as hard as any metal."
67,"A pitch-black shortsword that is invisible in firelight."
68,"A polished quarterstaff made from petrified redwood. The glossy sheen of the fossils displays its beautiful colouration of patches of blues, yellows and oranges with deep red veins running throughout the staff."
69,"A primitive dagger made by taking a human jawbone and inserting shards of obsidian in place of the teeth."
70,"A primitively decorated blowgun made of fire blackened wood, with a wide mouthpiece made of hammered copper that never oxidizes due to a special coating that seems beyond the skills of the people who made the barrel."
71,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ that made from scales, talons and teeth shed by a dragon. Spaced out along the weapon's length are precious metals and gems from a dragon's hoard. The weapon grows slightly warm when within 50 feet of a dragon."
72,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ that is unusually long and thin, yet surprisingly strong. The handle is made of a yellowed ivory, in which an observer will notice small glyphs and sigils constantly fading in and out of sight."
73,"A quarterstaff carved in the style of a totem pole with four wooden human figures in the fetal position stacked on top of each other, from top to bottom the human figures start large and get smaller."
74,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose surface is constantly melting and reforming into patterns filled with silently screaming faces, as if one for each person slain by the blade."
75,"A rapier with a blade composed of steel alloyed with brass. The weapon's hilt is wrapped in pebbled indigo deer leather. Its scabbard is of goat fur with brown suede accents and steel trim."
76,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ of exquisite workmanship, decorated with abstract patterns and inlays."
77,"A longsword of fine blue steel, hilted with a single cross-quillon and a plain, spherical polished knob pommel. Set in the heart of the tang, where the quillons meet just above the fine chain-wrapping of the grip, is a large cabochon-cut black sapphire."
78,"A redwood lance whose tip is shaped like an elongated heart."
79,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that is half the weight of a normal example of its kind. The object is black and inscribed with spiders, webs and references of a spider queen."
80,"A round shield about three feet across with a foot-long iron spike in the middle. The shield is made from two layers of wood with the grain of each layer at a right angle to the other layer increasing the strength of the shield. The wood is covered in a layer of decorated cowhide. The iron spike screws into a “puddle"" of lead in the middle of the shield and can be unscrewed and placed in a sheath on the back of the shield when not in use."
81,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ with pieces of bone and solidified ash seamlessly integrated into its form. The weapon vibrates slightly when a creature within 30 feet is dead or dying."
82,"A rusty shortsword with a thin, unblemished section along the centre of the blade. Inscribing the surname of an extinct gnomish noble family on that section attunes the sword to its family, causing it to act as a bane weapon against that family line."
83,"A sabre-like longsword with a narrow, slightly curved blade and almost nonexistent hand-guard. Its dark steel is inlaid with a mosaic of unpolished jet chips and raw rock crystal that date from a time before the written word."
84,"A sacrificial dagger with a serrated blade set into a hilt made of human bone carved in the shape of a scorpion's tail. After the weapon kills a living creature, a dark mist seeps from the dagger until the blood dries."
85,"A scimitar of rather poor steel, honed to a keen edge with a guard of iron curved into rearing serpents. Its grip is of leather, dyed red that looks as though it was recently replaced."
86,"A set of a dozen seemingly too heavy shuriken, strung on a twisted wire with an elaborate clasp in order to carry them."
87,"A shortsword gilded with interesting metalwork and discrete patterning. The blade is coloured a dull silver and the hilt is a matte gold-bronze."
88,"A shortbow made from the horn of a unicorn delicately split and fashioned by the fey."
89,"A shortsword of the gladius style that is about as average as it gets. The leather grip is slightly worn but comfortable, the metal of the blade is neither dull nor shining, and the edge is adequately sharp. The weapon would look perfectly at home at the side of any rank and file soldier."
90,"A sickle with a glowing white blade shaped like the moon, and an embellished navy blue hilt adorned with marble stars."
91,"A simple pugio (Dagger statistics) which comes in a heavy scabbard made of bone, wood, and thin strips of metal. The blade is immaculately sharp and bright, but the scabbard looks as though an ox stomped on it."
92,"A simply designed, light brown katar-style dagger, with a basic cross guard and an H shaped grip with a little bit of flair at the ends."
93,"A six foot long trident with a handle of dark wood and three prongs of red iron."
94,"A skillfully carved quarterstaff, each end carved in the likeness of a horned viper with hardened fangs. One half of the staff has been stained is a pale green, while the other has been stained is a deep black."
95,"A slashing shortsword with a black, fire opal grip with an onyx gemstone abutting the back of the heft. Engraved in the heft are the maker's marks; the image of a lion and a tiger, one on each of the sides. The wide blade extends from a small guard and is made of the highest quality steel that doesn't rust or stain. The weapon tingles the hand while held, in a sensation neither pleasant nor painful. Its sheath is made of lapis lazuli, inlaid with specks of precious metals, depicting a starry sky, the natural lines of the material having been used in the imagery of a landscape under night sky."
96,"A small steel boot-knife with a scrimshawed bone handle."
97,"A steel greatclub wrapped in scaly yellow shocker skin, its wrought iron head is covered with engraved lightning."
98,"A strange dwarven battleaxe that has one axe head, but the back of that is a large claw. The battleaxe has a chain and switch on the handle that allows the claw to close. The user can crash the claw into the ground and use it to pick up tightly packed or loose dirt or solid rock. The wielder can then swing the axe to throw the rock using the same statistics of a standard sling. If the wielder is proficient with the battleaxe they will also be considered proficient with its sling. The act of scooping up the dirt and launching can be done in a single smooth attack motion."
99,"A strange, mystical longspear that is difficult to look directly as if some restless force lies within it, just beneath the surface. The wood of the shaft is bone white and smooth, while the steel spearhead is textured like a stag's horn."
100,"A sizable claymore (Greatsword statistics) favored by the militant highland tribes. Apparently the weapon's crafter had a sense of humor, as etched into the flats of the blade are the words “FRONT TOWARDS ENEMY”."
