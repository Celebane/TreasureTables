1,"A waterproof scrollcase containing a key and a sheaf of official documents. According to the paperwork, the key opens a bankbox in a prestigious bank in a large city far away, and the lease on it has been paid for the next 100 years."
2,A beautifully painted set of castanets made out of sturdy oyster shells.
3,"A full mask of rippled black glass with thin slanted slits for the bearer's eyes. All who look upon it see distorted reflections of their own faults and failings, the slightest doubt twisted into a horrific swarm of phantoms that claw at the psyche of the victim. The bearer is never affected by the mask's powers but longtime users may find their sense of compassion and empathy withering away the longer they stare out of the dark veil's slanted eye slits."
4,"An aged papyrus scroll bearing the image of an open sarcophagus, its lid propped up against the side. In its contents are gemstones, jewelry, and even precious coin lain in among the rotting silks of long dead corpse. Wafts of green and brown can be seen emanating from the molded cloths, and around the open container the carcasses of sweltering animals and humans remain motionless as the plague eats away at the flesh."
5,"A well crafted, black cloth banner featuring a stylized skull breathing flames. A Knowledgeable PC will recognize the object serves as a rallying point for the free company of mercenaries known as the Black Company, who are highly respect and feared by allies and foes alike."
6,A three-lobed spinning device with almost frictionless ball bearings in the center. There are holes in the lobes and the center has a raised disk on both sides so the device can be held while it is spinning.
7,"A one gallon cask of Norscan Mead. Made from fermented honey, the beverage is also known as Sweet Brew and is too sugary to drink in great quantities, though a few fools do and regret it. Though it has a rich amber colour and a delicious taste, Knowledgeable PC's are aware that occasional batches contain a few contaminants that elicit strange visions and unsettling emotional outbursts. People usually risk the unusual side effects for a sample of this expensive beverage."
8,"A pulsing, mossy stone of unknown origin that glows with the light of life."
9,"An ivory statuette of a mermaid that is for the most part crudely carved, with the exception of certain 'features' which have been carved with lavish detail."
10,"A fine clay pipe, the bowl formed into the shape of a bearded man with a scarred face. The face is so detailed, that the bearer can even make out the arrow shaped earring, which Knowledgeable PC's will recognize as the mark of a well-known pirate gang."
11,Shivered Timber: A large shard of wood from a pirate ship's mast that is constantly tipped with frost. The implement can be used a focus for casting spells that deal cold damage.
12,A delicate china tea set painted in motifs of faraway lands. It's well wrapped in padded cloth and comes with its own matching box.
13,"A strange sextant crafted from tarnished brass, badly tanned leather, crudely shaped driftwood and milky glass, it's a tool only a seasoned mariner could appreciate, much less love. And yet, over the years various sailors have added their own touches such as a bundle of pigeon feathers tied with sinew to a thumbscrew, a rough etching of a stylized Kraken and an extra mirror. Regardless of its dubious decorations, the object works perfectly well as a navigational tool."
14,"A gruesome war banner sewn from strings of congealed gore, the flag radiates bloodlust so strong that those beneath it are filled with rage."
15,A brightly polished tin candle holder covered in silver snowflake decorations.
16,"A metal wargong, made from a shield that has seen more than its fair share of battle."
17,A glass jar containing orange and red fruit preserves. A rough and jolly swashbuckler is imprinted on the lid. Along the side is written “ Jelly Roger's Marmalade: To prevent scurvy on the high seas!”
18,A small pane of stained glass depicting a fire.
19,"A mask of terrifying craftsmanship, depicting in obsidian and void-fired bronze the agonized visage of a tortured angel. The facial covering constantly weeps tears of blood that evaporate without trace moments after falling from the mask"
20,"A metal torc that looks rather severe, with several upward-facing spikes. The words “Watchmen's Friend” is etched on the inside of the band. It would be very difficult to nod off when wearing such a serious piece of neckwear as the bearer would likely prick themselves on the spikes."
21,"A large whale's tooth that is finely carved, appearing to depict a young woman drowning at sea. Beneath is the name “Celia” and a few badly worn sentences that might explain her fate, but the words are very hard to read."
22,"A delicate chain of hand folded paper dolls, each delicately painted."
23,"A basket of blood fruit, a product of nature magic tainted by chaos and evil. The fruits resemble wan, black, malformed apples and are tautly filled with a mixture of blood and oily, dark ichors. Eating a blood fruit wracks the body with terrible stomach spasms and horrendous digestive issues."
24,"A worn, brass key nearly a handspan wide and decorated with thorny vines."
25,"A scarlet gem that shimmers in the bearer's hand like the pale cinders of cooling hearth. The bearer can feel its brittle heat wash over them, seething through their veins like serpents of liquid steel."
26,A dangling upside down rune etched in blood on strange leather parchment.
27,"A perfectly preserved tarantula, encased in a glass hemisphere."
28,"A simple wind instrument cut from a reed, commonly known as a whistlecane. They are so easy to make, that skilled bards frequently make and give them away to children-to the parents' delight or regret."
29,A lock of white hair trapped in amber.
30,"A small painting depicting an ugly and extremely overweight troll with a giant club resting on its shoulder, sitting on one side of a cobblestone bridge while a party of adventurers in armor waits on the other side in preparation, their armor gleaming in the sunlight and their spear heads glinting in bloodlust."
31,"A druid's staff of giant fennel covered with ivy vines, assorted leaves and topped with a pinecone."
32,A pan flute fashioned from hollowed out oak twigs.
33,"A single lens, hand magnifier with a wooden handle, on the grip is inscribed “For those who seek” in golden lettering."
34,A painted face mask of a jester with a rictus blood-red smile.
35,A stone tablet that bears inscriptions detailing a notable being who fell just short of achieving godhood.
36,A simple necromancer's staff with an ornate head as dark as onyx and decorated with arcane symbols designed to prey on the subconscious fears of mortals.
37,"A pair of goggles with light orange, round, translucent lenses that are mounted within a flexible metal frame that has a soft leather strap with a clasp at the back."
38,"A beaten leather bag containing various pliers, knives, hooks, shears and mind-weakening drugs strapped to its interior. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize the symbol of an order of demon hunters sewn into the inner lining, and deduce that these were one of their member's interrogation tools. Kits such as these were incredibly useful for convincing cultists and evildoers of all kinds to divulge their nefarious plots, as the interrogation tools appear intentionally gruesome. More often than not, the very presence of the cruel looking instruments is enough to induce a prisoner to talk. Unfortunately, these tools also inspire some very convincing lies. The use of these tools (Even by virtue of having the victim see them or describing how they will be used and how immensely painful they will be) grants the bearer advantage on intimidate checks made while questioning prisoners, but they impose disadvantage on all sense motive or insight checks made to determine whether the information gleaned is accurate or not."
39,A fully functioning xylophone made out of Giant's toe nails.
40,"A leather doctor's bag contains all the accouterments a phrenologist needs to measure skulls. The kit contains several metal skull calipers of various sizes, a labeled chalkware bust of a humanoid head, and numbered charts of skulls of various species."
41,A black leather half-mask that covers the bearer's nose and mouth and muffles their breathing.
42,A head sized array of complicated clockwork mechanisms that throb slightly as pulsing with an organic heartbeat.
43,A metal lantern of dwarven make that hangs from a short length of chain.
44,"A black silk choker, with a square orange stone set in its center."
45,An old glass bottle with a glass stopper sealed with wax. It contains a cloudy white liquid with ribbons of black and grey suspended in it.
46,"A firmly locked, steel chest, marked on the lid in multiple languages that this chest is ordered sealed by order of (Insert setting appropriate authority figure here), opening the chest is a crime, and that punishment for said crime is dismemberment and / or death. If opened, the container is found to be empty with the exception of a hastily scribbled note that reads “I.O.U. one Mcguffin”."
47,"An obsidian jewelry box with a black rose embroidered on it. The box is all sharp edges, oppressively heavy and has a jagged uneven surface."
48,"A delicate iron rod with an intricate pattern of constellations all over its surface and a moth-shaped handle in the middle. One end is marked by an eight-pointed star, while the other one displays a waning moon."
49,A pearlescent marble scepter topped by a blue gemstone cut in the shape of an eight-pointed star.
50,A porcelain mask depicting a slightly disgusted visage of an oligarch.
51,"A dreamcatcher, made from elk antlers and a silvery thread, adorned with an arrangement of dark and brightly colored feathers. The shape defined by its threads seem to change from time to time, but the resulting patterns are hardly discernible."
52,"A one gallon cask of Bretonnian brandy, known for being beloved by low and highborn alike. Perhaps the oldest liquor made by humans, it is made from fermented grape wine. Its distinctive taste and warming effect when consumed make it an excellent tonic for road-weary travelers."
53,"A woodcut relief depicting a woman in a rocking chair, knitting scarves and sweaters for her many grandchildren around. A warm hearth's fire lights the room in a golden glow, giving tone to each feature of each of the children's smiling faces. Only something thing is off about the picture. The woman eyes are sunken in holes of what might have once been eyes, her mouth a dried picture of a smile stuck into place like the muscles seized up in a corpse, her hands covered in lumpy growths which accent her impossibly knobby fingers. And weirdly, where there might be disgust or horror, the viewer only feels sympathy like one sufferer feels towards another sufferer."
54,A fully functioning clarinet carved from driftwood. The holy symbol of a minor lake deity is branded into the side
55,An intricate wooden box with delicate gold filigree and a wind up key on the back. If it is opened after having been wound-up a beautiful melody plays out.
56,"A slit drum made from a hollowed, fire hardened, hardwood log. The instrument has two slits on its topside, cut into the shape of an “H”. The resultant strips or tongues are then struck with a pair of mallets fashioned from deer antlers which are stored with the hollowed frame. Since the tongues are of different lengths and carved into different thicknesses, the drum produces two different pitches, near a fourth apart. The exterior is decorated with relief carvings of various deities and abstract monstrous designs. Some of these creatures are open-mouthed, providing increased volume through the hole at the end. The drum is one foot long and can be easily carried and played straps about the shoulders."
57,"A small and rather ordinary-looking flute carved from a piece of gray driftwood that plays beautiful, clear music."
58,A black velvet mask in the shape of a spider with four jointed wire legs protruding from each side of it. It covers the wearer's face completely but does not hinder vision or speech.
59,A small sack of shark leather that contains a handful of piranha teeth.
60,A compact ball of tightly wrapped steel wires that fits in one hand.
61,"A long, segmented conical trumpet, made of a lightweight metal that collapses into three sections for easier transportation."
62,"A set of soldier's studded red leather greaves that come up over the knees and cling tightly to the calf. There are no visible closures or bindings on the armor. The red leather is artfully burned with the pattern of twining vines. To remove the armor, a command word must be whispered which awakens the vines and relaxes them, allowing the greaves to slip off easily and quickly. To don them, the same verbal command must be uttered causing the vines tighten and recess into the leather once again."
63,A porcelain mask bearing cracks across it. The bottom right of the face from the jawline to the cheekbone to the chin is broken off. A viewer can just make out the expression of terror carved into the remaining features of the mask.
64,"A red potion flask fashioned in the shape of a bull filled with an amber liquid. If consumed, the drinker's face turns red and he becomes unable to sleep or rest properly for 1d20 hours. This does no eliminate the drinker's need for rest, it simply blocks their ability to do so."
65,"A forest elf's rucksack that is simply the treated husk of a giant seedpod, fitted with leather strap hinges and closed with buckled leather straps. The long, organic vessel is hard-sided and durable, with naturally formed compartments inside."
66,An eerie mask carved from bone to resemble the gaunt face of a terrifying vampire whose expression is that of inhuman malice.
67,"A shining baldric that seems to be woven from threads of steel, a skill only the finest of elven smiths have accomplished. Its peculiarly angled hanger is designed to carry an elven longsword."
68,"A tarnished bronze coin about the size of a palm. Mossy and damaged, this ancient coin is barely perceptible as valuable."
69,"A thick canvas messenger bag with the image of an anvil on one side, surrounded by four arms, each wielding a different tool."
70,"A worn playing card depicting an unsightly old woman with knobbled fingers peering over her shoulder towards the viewer, smiling with unholy glee, her jagged and misplaced teeth creating a haunting smile. When the bearer blinks, the figure is replaced with the viewer, looking fearful and bewildered."
71,A silver dragon scale that glows in the moonlight.
72,A silver coin which has been hollowed out and a tiny encrypted message placed inside.
73,A curious frogmouth purse filled with many unusually shaped dice. A few small figurines of various people and creatures and worthless coins are also in the bag.
74,A five inch gnome statuette that appears as if it is on the verge of speaking when it is almost out of view.
75,A board covered with runes and a silver weight tied to a string. Holding the weight over the board causes it to slowly spell the answer to any question asked. The response is never correct (Except by coincidence) and is always just the answer the person asking most wants to hear.
76,"A cube, with each side having nine squares with an eldritch symbol inscribed within the rich oak finish. The bearer can slide the cube around to shift the location of each face to match others. Some of them seem to glow when matched together, but so faint that it must be a trick of the light or the bearer's imagination."
77,"A four high wireframe model of a humanoid figure, made out of tin. The figure has an exquisitely detailed copper heart inside the dull ribcage."
78,A mask of bandage wrapping that has some strands loosely hanging off and others stained with dried blood. The filthy object has a slight smell of flesh putrefaction.
79,"A feather quill. Anything written with this quill will appear in a distinct and unknown handwriting. This unknown handwriting remains the same, regardless of who is writing with the quill."
80,A small pouch of glass marbles. Each marble has the abstract shape of a different animal embedded in the center of the glass.
81,"A large decorative candle. When lit, it gives off an alluring scent which, while impossible to identify, evokes a feeling of nostalgia in anyone who smells it."
82,"A small garden trowel. The blade and handle are made of common, if not poor-quality materials, but the handle is set with a single semiprecious stone."
83,A nail molded into the shape of a sword with pommel in the shape of a wolf's head.
84,"A tiny wooden horse with white hair for a mane and tail, and silver beads for eyes."
85,"A ceremonial dagger with an eye engraved on the hilt. Whenever the dagger is at the very edge of one's vision, they can swear it just blinked."
86,"A coin pouch. It sounds, weighs, looks and feels like it's filled with coins, but upon opening it the bearer discovers that it is empty."
87,A tarnished brass kazoo in the shape of a fish.
88,A thick hemp rope that ties itself into a hangman's knot whenever it's left unsupervised.
89,A pair of dice that seem to only roll 7s when in close proximity to gold or platinum.
90,"A hardy, darkened conch shell with an almost dangerous amount of ridges and points. By holding the shell up to their ear, the holder can hear rushing water and violent waves with an unusual degree of clarity. Continuing to listen the shell causes the bearer to slowly begin to experience sensations of seasickness and a pressure similar to being too deep underwater. As the sensations intensify, a muted, indecipherable whispering can be heard very faintly, as if it were coming from the bottom of the sea. The whispering continues to grow louder while the sensations escalate, until the whispers can almost be made out, at which point the bearer blacks out for a few seconds, dropping the shell."
91,A tiny bronze idol of a goblin carrying a knife in both hands and one knife clutched in his teeth.
92,"A simple ^RandomColour^ headband with a clear crystal set in the center of the brow."
93,"A rather large iron pot covered in scratches and scorch marks that can't seem to be taken off. Meals prepared by this pot are always palatable but in need of salt, regardless of whether the recipe called for salt, the consumer's enjoyment of salt, or amount of salt that was used in the cooking. Coincidentally, this effect can be nullified by adding copious amounts of pepper to the pot before serving the meal, in which case the food is always surprisingly delicious."
94,"A small, well-crafted statuette depicting a hulking metal, box-like figure of a humanoid sitting on a rock in the midst of a creek, holding in its hand a small magenta flower, examining it closely with its eye-less, mouth-less, nose-less, featureless face. The flower is richly colored which starkly contrasts the grey golem. A creature who examines the statue for more than a few seconds feels themselves growing cold and numb and only seeing in shades of grey as if their senses were fading away. The creature's faculties return to them the moment they stop interacting with the object."
95,"A brutal mask resembling a growling devil's face shaped from a single piece of a dark grey metal, save that the eyes and mouth are covered by bars like a prison cell."
96,"An ornate glasswork sculpture of a phoenix in all its resplendent glory, its wings spread majestically over the ember glow of an active volcano. The whole piece has been magically enchanted and the illusionary flames around the bird are animated and dance and drift off of the creature's feathers and the volcano occasionally erupts in showers of harmless sparks. The glass is warm to the touch and is as durable as steel."
97,"A single piece of parchment on which is inscribed a long list of potion ingredients, their properties, and price in a currency that doesn't exist anymore."
98,A small figurine of root and stone in the shape of a large earth elemental.
99,A minotaur's horn carved with all the names of their clan going back generations.
100,"A charcoal drawing displaying the scene of a mangy beast with a bovine skull looming over the corpse of a human woman. His thin body and exposed organs give the impression of hunger, a kind of starvation that consumes body and soul. The background is heavy shrouded in mist and two streams of vapor jet downward from his snout, blending into the air as if creating the blanketing fog. At the top of the image the picture is titled “Wendigo” and in the bottom right where the artist should have placed a signature simply has the hastily scrawled word “RUN”."
