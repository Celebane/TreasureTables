2,A sealed glass vial containing a dozen magically preserved seeds taken from an apple treant.
3,"A sealed glass vial filled with a smooth, creamy balm that has an overpowering sweet and heady flowery scent that masks the slight whiff of rot. Medically knowledgeable PC's can deduce that the soothing ointment is a false antidote for plague and pox ridden skin and is made from a variety of herbs, flowers and the rendered fat of those that have contracted said diseases and died in agony. Religiously educated PC's are aware that fanatic cultists of the plague God Nurgle will sell these fake cures at a bargain price in areas ravaged by plagues. The balm completely eliminates all pain and negative symptoms of the disease for one week but does not prevent the contagious nature of the sickness in any way, as the unknowing victim spreads the illness to all those who they come into contact with."

10,"A sealed glass vial filled with a glowing purple liquid swirling with black flecks.

The sinuous tentacle is heavily muscled like a long dry tongue covered in irregular blemishes, unnatural mottled coloring, small patches of hair and areas of perfectly smooth or heavily calloused skin. The abnormal limb is prehensile and can stretch out to ten feet allowing the creature to grab and hold (But not wield) objects, initiate grapples, shoves or other combat maneuvers and deliver touch attacks or spells that have a range of touch, all with the increased reach. The limb can even be swung with force as an unarmed attack the drinker is considered proficient with that deals as much damage as a club with a reach of ten feet. The tentacle last for 1d4 hours before retracting back into the creature's body."

25,"A sealed glass vial filled with a ^RandomColour^ liquid. If consumed, the drinker begins to see apparitions and specters in his periphery vision. These hallucinations resemble enemies he has dealt with in his past and the drinker develops a growing sense of paranoia as they seem to be attempting to reach out to him in a hostile manner.

27,"A sealed glass vial containing a glowing green liquid. If consumed, the drinker feels a strange tingling sensation under his shoulders and a secondary pair of arms burst out of his sides, bypassing armor and clothing.

The additional limbs are as well muscled their counterparts, allowing the creature's to excel at tasks that simply require overwhelming strength or sheer brute force. The drinker is able to give himself a couple of helping hands and gains advantage on all strength checks and any rolls made to grapple or wrestle. The arms last for 1d4 hours before retracting back into the creature's body."

46,"A sealed glass vial filled with a dense yellowish powder. Knowledgeable PC's will be able to identify it as powdered half-orc tusk and are aware that it is a highly illegal substance to transport or sell. Some people believe in a backwards superstition that consuming the substance can improve the physical strength, virility and constitution or the user, however there is no evidence of this being true.
