On each side of the weapon's center is a raised side profile of the God's face, while the top and rear spikes extend in rounded wavy patterns resembling rays of light. The halberd's blade is an expanding crescent edge as that of a solar flare. A creature looking the blade straight on can see both sides of the raised profiles and the last sight many creature ever see is the blazing face of the God of the sun hurling towards them."
3,A leather brace which holds five ornate throwing knives with strange creatures worshiped by a forbidden cult engraved in the blades and hilts.
4,A quarterstaff made of unidentifiable black wood as hard as steel and covered with precise geometric carvings.
5,A bleached club made out of an ogre's twisted thigh bone.
6,"The Dismal Blade: A shortsword whose color is pitch black from hilt to tip. It's hard to tell where the hilt ends and the blade begins. After being in possession of the weapon for at least an hour, the bearer develops a heavy feeling of dread and despair for as long as it's in their possession and dissipates an hour after leaving the bearer's person. Despite an increasingly grim outlook on life, most bearers will form an oddly familiar bond with the blade and are hesitant to part with it under most circumstances."
7,"The symbol of a human hand is etched on the grip of this ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^. During combat the wielder sometimes feels another hand grasp the handle of the weapon and control it for a fleeting second. On critical hits, the wielder feels as though the ghostly hand helped guide the weapon to the target's weak point and on critical misses it seems as though the spectral hand greatly impeded the blow. The ghostly hand does not actually provide any mechanical impact on the wielder's attacks."
8,"A cheap quiver holding a dozen crudely crafted arrows with wicked barbed arrowheads, most likely made by goblins or orcs. Despite their poor quality they fly just as well as a regular arrow and while the barbed heads deal no extra damage they are certain to leave terrible scars."
9,A scimitar made from the sharped curved tusk of a wereboar who was killed while in its shifted form.
10,A longsword spotted with blood stains that can never be properly cleaned. Its owner begins suffering from a recurring nightmare of accidentally cutting themselves. Eventually the owner awakens to find unexplained cuts on their hands.

12,"A shortsword with a hilt made of clear glass. Trapped in the hilt is a strip of parchment covered in strange runes.

13,A dagger with a hollow hilt accessed by unscrewing its bulbous pommel. Hidden inside is flint and steel and a ragged cloth for kindling.

15,"A dagger with a rat's skull set into the pommel. When the blade draws blood, the rat skull chatters and grinds its teeth."

The dose will remain viable within the gland for up to eight hours and will automatically be injected into the first creature the wielder successfully strikes."

25,"A heavy, wide-bladed shortsword with the tip coated in dried blood. The weapon is plain and unadorned but wickedly sharp. It rests in a scabbard comprising some odd leathery material. A short tassel made of entwined hair hangs from its grip."
26,A dagger made from a shard of ice wrapped in mammoth hide. The ice never melts but does mist constantly whenever the weapon is drawn.
27,"A hemp sack that holds two dozen sling stones. Each of the stones has an angry dwarven face carved into its surface and holes bored through their middle. When hurled, these stones make an eerie whistling sound."
28,"A javelin whose shaft is carved in an ornate spiraling pattern, that always returns when thrown, exactly halfway between the wielder and the target."
29,A magnificent elven longsword filigreed with mithril. The runes on the blade suggest it once belonged to a noble of great importance.
30,A pair of bright pink brass knuckles with rhinestone studs
31,A pair of plain looking leather work gloves with band of moulded brass sown into the knuckles. The gloves function as a pair of brass knuckles but only a very careful eye can see the slight bulge around the knuckles.

34,"A quarterstaff made entirely from a single piece of magically strengthened green jade that's as durable as steel. When swung, the weapon leaves a faint trail of wispy green mist in its wake."
35,"A scabbard and a longsword both of which bear distinctive but wildly different decorative markings. The scabbard obviously belongs with another sword, as it is much too long in addition to the differing patterns. However, both the short sword and the scabbard share the same markings, and with every dawn, the short sword appears within the scabbard, no matter where it was left earlier"
36,A serrated steel garrote that easily cuts through wood and can function as a small saw.

44,"A stout smoking pipe seemingly made of lacquered wood. In fact the pipe is made from hardened iron, expertly painted to pass for wood, and makes for an excellent bludgeoning weapon (Treat it as a club that deals half damage) in a pinch. The pipe can be used to smoke, but is very heavy, requiring at least one hand to hold it up. The wielder gains advantage on all disguise and bluff checks to pass it off as a smoking pipe rather than a weapon."
45,A well made walking staff (Quarterstaff statistics) that stays perfectly balanced when placed tip down.
46,"A well-crafted heavy mace which bears a horrid face set in a grimace atop the haft. Whenever swung, the mouth snarls, displaying several rows of jagged fangs."

53,"Plaid Mace of the Squirrel: A steel mace completely covered in a gaudy green and red tartan pattern that's stained into the very metal and cannot be removed. The brightly polished metal of green and red with defining white lines seems to clash with everything and the wielder suffers disadvantage on any checks made to conceal the weapon from sight. Whenever the mace successfully strikes and enemy, the wielder becomes instinctively aware of the exact location of the nearest stash of nuts within a one-mile radius. —Note: Peanuts are not nuts."
54,"This ^AllRandomWeapon^ grip is made of hardened yellow bone. At complete random intervals, blood curdling death screams will echo forth from the general area where the weapon is."
55,"The ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^'s grip is made of pure black onyx. Whenever the weapon is used in combat, the wielder's skin becomes deathly pale and the color of their eyes turn solid black. When combat ends, the wielder's eyes and skin slowly return to normal over the course of a minute. The wielder is also left feeling cold and melancholy for a short time after using the weapon."
56,"The ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^'s grip is made of pure white oak. Whenever the weapon is used in combat, the wielder's skin becomes pitch black and the color of their eyes turn solid white. When combat ends, the wielder's eyes and skin slowly return to normal over the course of a minute. The wielder is also left feeling feverishly warm and giddy for a short time after using the weapon."
57,"The ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ has a pure white grip that appears to have black forms flitting across it when observed out of the the corner of the wielder's eye. The dark images are not present when the grip is examined nor do creatures other than the wielder observe this phenomenon. During combat, the wielder sees shadowy figures darting around in their peripheral vision, which reach for the weapon but never quite touch it."
58,"This ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ has a grip made of solid blue ice. Holding the weapon makes the wielder's hand feel tired, numb and cold. When it becomes almost unbearable to continue holding the weapon, a faint and undecipherable whispering is breathed into the wielder's ears. An intelligent PC will believe the entire effect to be a specific yet powerful illusion as the wielder never suffers any lack of function out of his “numb” hand and the freezing sensation dissipates seconds after the weapon is released."
59,A heavy crossbow made from the wood of a lighting charred yew tree and studded with hearts carved of rose zircon
60,"An incredibly strong whip, with a fleshy throng that resembles the long suction-cupped tentacle of an octopus. When cracked the whip lets loose a series of giggles from the twisted mouths carved along the bottom of its obsidian handle."
61,"A battle axe with an oak shaft on which dozens of acorns symbols have been carved. Every morning, the bearer will wake-up to find a single acorn loosely attached to the bottom of the weapon's grip."
62,"An otherwise unassuming, lightweight bastard sword with what appears to be an angry, tooth-filled mouth engraved at the bottom of the blade where the weaponsmith's mark would be. When swung, the blade let's out a loud and fierce battle cry and a on a successful hit, the blade makes crude taunts to its foe."
63,"A shimmering fullblade with a pommel of red leather. The blade is strong, sharp, and appears to be forged out of small shards of other swords, making it glitter in the sunlight ."

65,"A regular looking ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ with a soft pink leather grip. Whenever the wielder misses on an attack, the leather grips becomes wet, soft and tongue like for a fraction of a second. The tongue-like grip moves, licking the wielder's hand and making the weapon slightly slippery before becoming inanimate again. This phenomenon occurs so quickly that it is impossible to determine if the grip actually moved or if it was some kind of trick. Even the tongue's wet saliva can easily be attributed to sweat."
66,"A surprisingly durable garrote comprised of braided silver wire, with handles made from cold iron. Both handle have matching symbols etched on them of an arrow piercing a full moon."
67,"The air around the bearer of this ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ is always unnaturally cold. The bearer's breath becomes a visible fog, and frost continually forms on the surface of their hair, skin, weapons, and armor. The bearer and his equipment never suffers any ill effects from the frost nor does he ever gain any sort of benefit."
68,"The ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ feels heavier that it should, as if was being weighed down by something trapped within. During combat, dark apparitions bound to this weapon haunt the edges of the wielder's peripheral vision. They become hideously visible to only the wielder whenever the weapon is used to kill, as the twisted ghosts snatch part of the dying creature's soulstuff, adding it to the collective misery of all creatures ever slain by the weapon."
69,A two handed woodsman's axe (Greataxe statistics) with the symbol of a key etched into both sides of the blade's head.

74,A greatclub fashioned from the femur of a young black dragon. The weapon is covered in pitted spots that look like acid burns.

77,"A quarterstaff crafted from the heartwood of an ash tree and covered in decorative carvings that tell a sad tale of a loved one who battled and lost to a powerful mage.

78,"A wicked looking switchblade in a leather sheath, both of which are colored a mottled black pattern that seems to blend into shadows. The sheath has a number of straps and can be easily adjusted to fit comfortably in any number of areas including wrists, ankles, below or over a shoulder, waist, boot, etc. A perceptive PC will notice on careful inspection, that the weapon's grip has the words “Never give up without a fight.” etched into it."
79,"A silver-headed heavy mace, the head of which is shaped into the likeness of a ram's head. The mace doesn't look like it's seen any combat use (Although it was designed with combat in mind and is sturdy and well balanced) and may be an heirloom or serve a ceremonial purpose."
80,"A steel rapier in an ornate, electrum-trimmed scabbard worked in swirling patterns. The rapier itself seems to be of questionable quality at best and clearly not the intended mate for the scabbard"
81,A finely crafted steel trident wrapped in a sharkskin grip. Four rows of shark teeth line the shaft just below the tines and three small holy symbols of a water-demon cult are etched in the steel near the butt end.
82,"A scimitar with a memorizing blade forged with a distinctive pattern of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water. The hilt is gold, set with a gleaming citrine with a snakeskin grip."

88,"A short, broad-bladed club in the shape of an enlarged tear drop, made entirely out of a single piece of nephrite jade and a leather grip."
89,"A rich mahogany walking stick with odd wear patterns on the handle, as though it's routinely used upside down. If the handle is given the proper series of twists it detaches, revealing it to be a sword cane (Shortsword or rapier statistics) with a patterned steel blade."
90,"A small hilt-less dagger (Just a handle and a blade) made entirely out of black ceramic. Lightweight, razor sharp and easily concealable the weapon is a prize for assassins and thieves. The weapon weighs half as much as a normal dagger and grants advantage to all checks made to conceal it from sight. Whenever the wielder rolls a natural 1 on a hit with this weapon, they must roll an additional 1d4. If the roll is another natural 1, roll damage as normal and the weapon shatters, dealing half of the damage to the wielder as well as the target."
91,A bright shining longsword that always smells strongly of wildflowers.
92,A whip crafted from ink-black leather tipped with barbs of black iron.
93,An ebony sword cane (Shortsword statistics) concealing a silver sword that is impossible to unsheath unless in direct moonlight.
94,A whip made from braided vines with a six inch thorn on the end of it. It's handle is made from wicker and the name of the weapon “Nature's Lash” is shaped into the wicker grip in druidic script. It looks as though the weapon used to have additional magical properties but the enchantment has faded

96,"A dagger made of cold iron which was beaten into shape with nothing but raw, brute strength. A knowledgeable PC will remember that popular lore asserts that fey creatures and some fiends are especially vulnerable to cold iron weaponry."

98,"A large oaken crook decorated with calming whorling lines. This is a reinforced version of the simple tool well known to shepherds everywhere and is essentially just a quarterstaff with a curving, blunt hook on one end. Shepherds use the hook to guide their livestock, balance on rocky terrain and scare off predators."

100,"A thin silver rapier that hums when swung. Should the wielder sing, hum or chant in any kind of musical rhythm, the rapier vibrates creating an audible tone that harmonizes with the wielder's voice."
