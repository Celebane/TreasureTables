1,"Intensified Spell: By means of an expedited blood rite, the caster sacrifices a few drops of blood flowing within his veins, thereby infusing the spell with additional metaphysical power, greatly enhancing its lethality. For each damage die rolled to determine the spell's damage, the caster adds an additional +1 damage to the spell's total resulting damage. If the spell deals damage over multiple rounds, this metamagic only effects the first set of damage dice rolled. —Note: If a normal Fireball spell deals 8d6 fire damage, an Intensified Fireball would deal 8d6+8 fire damage."
2,"Multiversal Spell: The caster alters the foundations of the spell with quantum architecture, creating a superposition between this universe and one other. In the different parallel dimension, the other version of himself has also just performed the same spell and the caster can choose to swap the effects of that spell with the one he cast, essentially stealing the arcane power from himself. The player rolls the spell's damage die twice and choose either result to use. If the spell has variable effects other than damage, (Such as Prismatic Spray or Reincarnate) the caster can also roll those effects twice and choose either result to use. The choice of results must be done after damage or other effects are rolled but before it is dealt to the target. If the spell deals damage over multiple rounds, this metamagic only effects the first set of damage dice rolled."
3,"Maximized Spell: A complex overlapping, echoing of the precise gestures and esoteric words performed by the caster, causes the spell to become extraordinarily, unforgivingly efficient. After successfully casting a spell, the player may select any single damage die of his choosing and that die will be considered to have rolled the maximum possible result for that type (Like 8 on a d8) instead of the current result. This must be done after damage is rolled but before it is dealt to the target. If the spell deals damage over multiple rounds, this metamagic only effects the first set of damage dice rolled."
4,"Persistent Spell: The caster performs the lasts few seconds of the spell's verbal and somatic elements twice, creating a supernatural echo that increases the spell's tenacity as the targets attempts to resist. All creatures who succeed on their saving throw against the spell, must make another saving throw against the effect and gain advantage on that roll. If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw."
5,"Enlarged Spell: The caster performs the physical motions of the spell with large sweeping arms gestures and stretching the vowels of the mystic incantations out, widening the spell's casting to match its effect. The altered spell occupies a larger space and any burst, cone, emanation, radius or other numeric measurement of the spell's area of effect is increased by five feet."
6,"Careful Spell: The caster performs the spell with deliberate, meticulous precision, every movement of each finger and every syllable uttered is completed with absolute perfection. If the spell forces creatures to make a saving throw, the caster can choose any number of creatures he can see and those creatures automatically succeeds on the first saving throw against the spell."
7,"Empowered Spell: The caster modulates the spell's ethereal frequency on the fly, adjusting it to vibrate to best suit the environment. While these tweaks can greatly improve the spell's effect, there lies a possibility of accidental self-sabotage. When the caster rolls for damage, he can reroll any of the dice regardless of the result but must use the new roll even if it's worse. This must be done after damage is rolled but before it is dealt to the target. If the spell deals damage over multiple rounds, this metamagic only effects the first set of damage dice rolled."
8,"Amplified Spell: Through sheer force of will, the caster bends the laws of nature to his command, releasing a spell of tremendous power. All of the spell's effects are treated as if the caster had expended a spell slot one level higher than it was actually cast at."
9,"Magnified Spell: The caster taps into the the transmundane matrix of his material spellcasting focus to overload the spell at the cost of the object's integrity. The item crackles with power as hairline cracks form along its length. Should the caster not require an item as a spellcasting focus, the metamagic floods his power with arcane might causing minor bruising across his entire body. All of the spell's damage dice increase by one step to the next largest dice. If a normal Fireball spell deals 8d6 fire damage, a Magnified Fireball would deal 8d8 fire damage. If the spell deals damage over multiple rounds, this metamagic only effects the first set of damage dice rolled. —Note: The metamagic's descriptive text is for flavour and is not meant to cause any real mechanical damage to the item or the caster and is intended to add to the immersive roleplaying experience."
10,"Extended Spell: The caster exploits a quirk of very concept of time to use a few seconds of his own lifespan as fuel to empower the spell. Sacrificing the limitless abstract potential of his future allows the caster to reap immediate, tangible benefits. The duration of the spell's effect is doubled to a maximum duration of 24 hours."
11,"Piercing Spell: The caster folds the raw elemental energies of the spell into itself, distilling it into a pure essence. This primordial substance is vastly more lethal than normal. A spell of Piercing fire can burn through asbestos, its acid will dissolve tempered glass, its cold can freeze helium and lighting will conduct through thick rubber. The spell ignores all resistances to the damage type it deals. A target who would take half damage due to resistance takes full damage instead. If the target is fully immune to the damage type, they instead suffer half of the damage the spell deals as it pierces their natural protection."
12,"Heightened Spell: The caster distills the spell's power into a potent, targeted incantation. One creature of the caster's choice targeted by the spell, suffers disadvantage on the first saving throw to resist the spell's effects."
13,"Subtle Spell: Instead of actually performing the usual physical gestures and vocal components of the spell, the caster vividly envisions doing so to such a perfect degree that it's more accurate to call it a vivid hallucination than an ideal daydream. This flawless mental conceptualization allows one to cast a spell without uttering a single syllable or moving so much as an eyelash. The caster is able to cast the spell without any somatic or verbal components and does not need or move or speak whatsoever. If the spell requires material components, the caster simply needs to have those items on his person."
14,"Distant Spell: The caster performs the physical motions of the spell with pantomiming reaching motions, extending his arms and drawing out the spoken vowels as if he was grabbing for something just out of reach in slow motion. This stretching of the spell's design allows the caster to affect targets much farther away than normal. The range of the spell is doubled and if the spell had a range of touch it now has a range of 30 feet."
15,"Devastating Spell: Using risky dweomercrafted formulas of condemned battlemagic, the caster is able to momentarily form violent glyphs inside his own mind, inflicting agony on himself as if his brain was injected with boiling acid. While the caster is not actually harmed per se, the flash of pain is excruciating and the resulting emotional turmoil feeds into the spell, augmenting its lethal potential. The caster can roll one of the spell's damage die an additional time and add the result to the total damage. If the spell deals damage over multiple rounds, this metamagic only effects the first set of damage dice rolled.  —Note: For example , if a normal Fireball spell deals 8d6 fire damage, a Devastating Fireball would deal 9d6 fire damage."
16,"Bouncing Spell: The caster wraps the spell's core metastructure in a rubbery layer of delving magic designed to test the target's defenses. As the victim attempts to defy the spell's power, the delving absorbs the force created by the target's resistance, like a rubber ball thrown at a pane of glass. Should the target fail to resist, the delving layer fades as the spell breaks through but should the victim be particularly defiant, the rubbery magic bounces away to deliver the spell's core to a new target. Whenever a Bouncing spell targeting a single creature has no effect on its intended target (Whether due to spell resistance or a successful saving throw) the caster may redirect it to target another eligible creature within range. The redirected spell behaves in all ways as if its new target were the original target for the spell. Spells that affect a target in any way (Including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) may not be redirected in this manner."
17,"Seeking: The caster weaves strands of illusionary magic into the spell's supernatural tapestry. The metamagic warps the appearance of a magical projectile, randomly altering its shape, size, direction or number of bolts, orbs or missiles that the caster releases. A Seeking Ray effect may visually appear to take a spiraling or zigzagging flight path or to branch out into multiple beams, while its actual trajectory is a straight line masked by the illusion. These filaments of glamour and misdirection are crude at best, with little more power than a simple cantrip but in the heat of battle it is next to impossible to determine what is real and what is mystic fiction. On the turn the spell is performed, the caster gains advantage on one spell attack roll of his choosing."
18,"Scourging Spell: The caster invokes all manner inauspicious superstitions into his spell, tracing symbols of good luck backwards and upside down in the air, uttering the names of adversarial demons (Thus risking their attention) and altering the spell's arcane frequency to enwrap the target in malevolent vibrations. Together these efforts create a true atrocity of an incantation that burden's the target with grave misfortune as they attempt to resist its harmful outcome. One creature of the caster's choice targeted by the spell, subtracts 1d4 from the first saving throw made to resist the spell's effects."
