1,"A one-foot long curved yellow ruler dotted with brown spots, that strongly resembles a banana. Due to the crescent moon shape of the instrument, its almost entirely useless at measuring most objects. It does for some reason function extraordinarily well when used to provide a sense of scale."
2,"A rusted iron door knocker in the shape of a gargoyle. Its mouth is open and the knocker itself is held in it's front claws. If the knocker is touched the gargoyle's mouth grinds into movement and issues a verbal warning: “Disturb not this chamber, lest the world suffer!” The gargoyle can issue this warning once a minute."

4,"A cursed fishing pole made of blackened ash. Despite the skill of the bearer or the attractiveness of the bait used, it will never catch a fish. However, if one attempts to use it unbaited in a populated body of water, they will succeed in catching a dead and rotting fish."
5,An age-worn ivory figurine which bears an uncanny resemblance to a young woman the PCs have met recently.
6,A single leaf from the great tree Yggdrasil. Despite being separated from the world tree it seems perfectly healthy. Legend has it that it will only begin to wilt as a sign that Ragnarok (The end of the world) is imminent.
7,A set of wooden wind chimes which plays a different tune depending upon the direction of the wind which disturbs it.
8,"A charm of twisted black obsidian. Touching the charm grants the bearer fleeting, ghostly visions from a strange and alien world. The plane is utterly different in every particular aspect, but eerily similar to the bearer's own world in its broad scope and form."
9,A collection of love letters from an infatuated client to a woman who worked in a brothel
10,"A carved wooden duck call. When blown, it sounds like a male duck (A drake) in rut and could bring a hen duck on to the scene, or any other predatory creature or poacher that enjoys hunting ducks."
11,"A thin wooden sign, two feet wide by one foot tall, that in bold red writing states “Beware of the Leopard”."

25,A roll of insect netting large enough to completely cover a grown man lying prone.
26,An old military medal awarded to a soldier who had been injured in battle. The award is in the shape of a heart and is strung on a thick purple ribbon.
27,A surprisingly clean pair of steel needle-nose pliers
28,"A dried and preserved human foot has been fixed to the butt end of an otherwise normal woodsman's axe. If placed butt end on the on the ground, the foot provides enough stability for the axe to remain upright."
29,A heavy scroll case made of solid iron.
30,"Eye of Tyr: A gift from the God of Justice, this pommel gem gleams with a holy fire. Legends say that if the stone were to be set into the hilt of a weapon of virtue by a true believer and wielded by a warrior of the faith, the result would be a blade capable of carving a righteous swath through all the evils that plague the Realms."
31,"A clawed hand of a Baalor that pulses with evil power. Though harmless enough in its present state, there are rumors that the magic of a demon's claw can be unleashed by combining the appendage with another powerful item of evil."
32,A brace of half a dozen humanoid scalps. All of the scalps bear the same strange tattoo which knowledgeable PC's will recognize as originating from an evil cult. Perhaps the local city has some sort of bounty for them…
33,"A key carved from bone that will fit most locks but will break off when turned, jamming the locking mechanism with shards of bone."
34,"A silver coin stamped with a worn, unfamiliar design of a hawk-winged helm"
35,A glass jar filled with vinegar and a dismembered troll finger that twitches occasionally. It seems like the weak acid from the vinegar is keeping the finger in a sort of stasis. You imagine that if it was removed it might fully regenerate…
36,A silver coin that makes no noise when dropped or hit against something
37,"A clockwork owl that wound, spins its head and hoots softly for a minute"
38,"A blue, glowing crystal shard the size of a pinkie finger"

42,"A silk headband decorated with a single green cat's eye gem in its center. The bearer sometimes feels as though they can access another sense (Like telepathy, mind reading or telekinesis) focused through the gem but the sensation always fades before the bearer can make use of it"
43,"A clear glass bottle filled with one liter of pure distilled alcohol. The bottle is securely sealed but is not wrapped in anything protective, which seems foolhardy at best and suicidal at worst…"
44,A sealed glass jar with a live butterfly inside of it. The blue insect flutters around occasionally and seems to be in good spirits. The jar cannot be unsealed but the butterfly never seems to suffer from lack of fresh air or food and never dies.
45,A wooden travel trunk. Inside the case is a layer of padding and a glass display case. Inside the sealed case is a collection of dead butterflies pinned to a painted cork board. Under each specimen is a piece of parchment detailing the common and scientific name of the insect. There are dozens of butterflies of varying sizes and colors.
46,"A pair of comfortable fuzzy house slippers. Rather than conventional materials, the slippers are made from malleable unbreakable glass. You get the feeling there was a miscommunication about the specifics of this item when the glass slippers were created."

48,A braided copper bracer that is uncomfortably warm to the touch.

69,"An ordinary looking black scarf containing five chicken eggs firmly secured in secret pockets. Close inspection shows the eggs have been drained of the yolk with two small pinpricks and have been filled with fine powdered ash then resealed with dabs of wax. These eggs can be used as thrown weapons or launched from a sling. Upon impact these eggs explode, throwing up a small cloud of ash that quickly dissipates. This can distract creatures, provide partial cover or potentially blind. These homemade smoke grenades are meant for distraction and misdirection rather than as an offensive weapon and don't deal any damage."
70,"A clay jar covered in faded runes describing its contents. The jar is wrapped in linen, and inside rests the heart of an ancient hero who gave her life to save the woman she loved."
71,"A wooden cup that, when placed against an ear, relays the sounds of a drunken tavern party."

84,A sheet of white canvas 2' X 3' stretched on a wooden frame. The painting is entirely taken up with the scrawling phrase “SUFFERING IS NOT ART!” which was apparently written in the painter's own blood as some sort of artistic statement.

86,A single black feather that somehow weighs five pounds and would make an interesting paperweight

The king invites the PC's and any companions to come visit him at the site of his grave in order to aid him in a troubling quest regarding matters too sensitive to place on parchment.
