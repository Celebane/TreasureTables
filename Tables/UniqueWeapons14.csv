1,"A bright, turquoise-blue trident with serrated edges, grown from the hardest coral of the ocean. The saw-like edges of the trident's prongs account for the slashing injuries this weapon can deliver."
2,"Snapdragon Bag: An unassuming-looking, brown leather sack, the inside of which is lined with four spring-loaded metal ribs. Known as a snapdragon bag, when it's thrown at an enemy's face with a successful attack (See Note), the sudden impact releases the spring-loaded ribs, which snap forward to enclose the target's head. A victim enclosed by the snapdragon bag is rendered blind until it is removed or destroyed. —Note: The snapdragon bag has the same statistics as a weighted net (Including how to escape) except that rather than being physically restrained, the target is blinded.  If the snapdragon bag is removed rather than destroyed, it can be reset with an action equivalent to attacking."
3,"An aged bronze gladius (Shortsword statistics). Moaning, weeping faces can be glimpsed in its verdigris."
4,"A farmer's sickle that has been strengthened for use as a weapon. These blades are favored by druids for utilitarian reasons and anyone who wants a weapon that might be overlooked by guards."
5,"A greatclub, ornately crafted from fine maple wood. At the head of the club is an accurate carving of a wolf's head, snarling and baring its teeth. Along the handle, the phrase “The Gatherer of Beasts Shall Bring on the New Age” are carved out in Giant. This club may be used to deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning, using the wolf's carved teeth to puncture the enemy. Hostile beasts seem hesitant to attack the wielder, sometimes choosing to attack other enemies."
6,"A composite shortbow. Its leather wrapped handgrip not only bears signs of extensive use, but also great care on the part of previous owner."
7,"A marvellously crafted katana with a blade of bright, immaculate steel and a gold tsuba worked to resemble a pair of male lions circling the blade. The hilt is ivory inlaid with more gold, all wrapped in purple silk and capped with a golden lion's head bearing amethyst eyes and ruby teeth. Whenever the blade is drawn, this lion's head lets out a mighty roar that can be heard for approximately a quarter of a mile."
8,"A masterfully designed ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ adorned with unique decorative elements. Whenever the weapon is wielded in combat, the words “^AllRandomBattleCries^” thunder in the bearer's mind as if shouted by a raging berserker."
9,"A whip consisting of a long metal chain that ends in a metallic, spiked sphere with a few aerodynamic holes."
10,"An airtight waxed leather quiver containing Resolve: {Roll 3d6+3} arrows whose heads are heavily coated in a sticky, foul-smelling substance. These aromatic ammunition pass on their fragrant material to a creature hit by them. A creature tracking a victim marked by one of the pungent arrows gains advantage on the survival roll they make to follow the target. A creature with a particularly keen nose (Like a dog or wolf) automatically succeeds at tracking the target by smell. The foul-smelling substance washes off a victim in five minutes of scrubbing with ample water or fades naturally after 2d4 hours pass."
11,"A brown dagger with feather motif on the hilt. There's a hawk's eye gem in the pommel."
12,"A double axe of orcish design (Greataxe statistics), consisting of a pair of large double-sided axe heads mounted on both ends of a pole."
13,"A flail whose handle is made of driftwood with a small anchor attached to it by a chain. The anchor and chain are perpetually coated in damp barnacles and pieces of seaweed."
14,"A ceremonial, double-edged dagger used by high priests of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ who would use it to direct and store the spiritual energy released by their congregations while ritual is being performed. This tool is never used to physically cut anything but the blade is kept honed and polished to a mirror-like finish. The hilt of the athame is not crafted of metal but rather of bones and gemstones, intricately carved and carefully smoothed to form an artistic hilt."
15,"A double-bitted hefty greataxe. Each blade has a vicious edge that thirsts for the enemies of its wielder."
16,"A cold iron dagger with a jade hilt featuring an image of a solar banishing a pit fiend back to the Nine Hells."
17,"A double-bladed scimitar with a haft of fine wood that supports a long, curving blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over centuries, the blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. The scimitar is a masterpiece, and even a casual inspection would reveal it to be an expensive weapon, though Knowledgeable PC's know that few ever have the opportunity to purchase one. Those PC's are aware that the double-bladed scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves and a Valenar blade in the hands of a non-elf is generally assumed to have been stolen or looted from a fallen foe. A Valenar elf might feel entitled to demand its return or challenge the bearer to prove they're worthy to wield it."
18,"A curved, double-edged dagger, so extreme in its curvature that the point extends at a right angle away from the hilt. The angled-knife can be a vicious weapon in the right hands, dealing serious wounds to even a well-armored enemy."
19,"A pristine quiver containing Resolve: {Roll 3d6+3} finely made hardwood arrows. Each tipped with a point of sharpened red agate, cut with many intricate faces."
20,"A dagger forged from steel with traces of adamantine flecked into the blade's edge. The weapon features a sophisticatedly designed handle."
21,"A fullblade of immense size, made of a dense meteoric metal. The massive blade is designed to be wielded with unrestrained fury, with savage cleaving strikes rather than refined and precise swordplay."
22,"A gnarled black oak staff topped by an iron crescent moon mounted to the wood by tentacle-esque roots that grasp the metal tightly, as if they had grown around it. The moon gives off an eerie chill and the staff's wood is dry and cold, yet glistens as if wet, and feels heavy, as if waterlogged."
23,"A dagger with a spiral hilt and a broad, serrated blade that tapers to a sharp point. Whenever the knife is set down, it immediately rights itself to balance on the tip of the blade, always at a 90-degree angle to any surface it touches, regardless of gravity."
24,"A gnomish made, tin case containing Resolve: {Roll 2d6+2} crossbow bolts that knowledgeable PC's will recognize as Splintering Bolts. Each of these bolts is actually a dozen smaller flechettes loosely bound together and designed to come apart from the force of being fired. When fired, a Splintering Bolt immediately separates, creating a 30-foot cone of metal-tipped splinters. The wielder makes one attack roll as normal for the crossbow and all creatures in a 15 foot cone from where the wielder is facing are pelted with the flechettes. The attack is compared to their Armor Class (Or Defense Value, Dodge or other relevant game statistic), then the wielder then rolls one damage roll as normal for a crossbow and each creature hit takes that damage. The bolts cannot be poisoned or coated in alchemical material and are destroyed after use and are not recoverable."
25,"A greatsword with a deep black blade of much too heavy iron. Fine lines of basalt stone run lengthwise through the metal. The hilt is made of ebony and bound with silvery spider silk. Deep black gel drips from the blade when someone is cut by it. The substance is completely tasteless but if consumed, one experiences a random, vague memory of the person cut."
26,"A warhammer with a massive square head plated with a well-worn, gold alloy. On each side of the head near the front there is a small hole that seems to be made to hold a prism or gemstone. The handle is forged from a blue steel and tightly wrapped in cloth."
27,"A hand crossbow of black-stained wood, carved to present the face of a ram at the front. Its dull steel arms are fronted by the carved beast's curling horns."
28,"A handaxe consisting of a shard of blue metal with coral hues, bound to a piece of driftwood by an old ship rope and seaweed."
29,"A heavy crossbow covered in ancient dwarven runes that cover the tiller and lathe of the weapon."
30,"A heavy crossbow modified to fire a special, grapple-headed metal bolt attached to 100 feet of thin, light rope. A successful shot at an appropriate target indicates that the grapple has hooked onto something, anchoring the rope firmly enough for a creature to ascend it. This device helps adventurer's scale walls, bridge chasms, escape down sheer cliffs, and the like. It cannot fire typical crossbow bolts."
31,"A heavy eldritch rod (Mace statistics) that is warm to the touch and covered in living human skin. Along the length of the rod eyes of all colors stare endlessly. Between the eyes rest a number of mouths, silently closed."
32,"A heavy, two-handed hammer, this maul has a set of hinged jaws mounted to the front of the head. A pivot inside them closes these jaws whenever the maul strikes a solid object. Originally designed for mining, when wielded in combat the weapon leaves deep ragged wounds that bleed profusely and the jaws latch on to the victim on a good solid hit. Whenever the wielder attacks with advantage and scores a hit against a target, the pivot is triggered and the jaws grab somewhere on the target's body. The wielder is then disarmed of the maul but the target is considered stuck in a hunting trap, as the maul weighs them down and restricts movement. After the piston has been triggered, the wielder suffers disadvantage on all attacks with the weapon until the jaws are reset with an action equivalent to attacking. Should the wielder ever roll a natural 1 on an attack roll with the jawed maul, there is a 25% chance that the trapping mechanism becomes damaged, rendering the trap uselessly. When this occurs the wielder suffers disadvantage on all attacks with the weapon until a character proficient with smiths or tinkers tools repairs it over the course of one hour and 1d10 gold pieces worth of material."
33,"A huge fullblade with a six-foot blade and a two-foot hilt that is surprisingly easily wielded with two hands by any warrior. The blade is rippled, with a vein of gold running down the center. The hilt is wrapped in red leather flecked with gold. The guards are of unicorn horn and the basket is a leering, bearded face from pommel to guard."
34,"A kama (Sickle statistics) with a vicious obsidian blade that does not glint in the presence of light. Darkness and shadows seem to almost bleed towards and seep into its keen edge."
35,"A longbow wrought from the boughs of an old, resilient tree. Its wooden frame is exceptionally sturdy but difficult to draw."
36,"A large greataxe with a head carved from slate sharpened to a honed multi-pointed edge. The stone of the blade is covered in old intertwined runes that connect three slots within its blade. The handle is simple and wooden in design, over the years it has had many wielders and has thus been carved and adorned with many different iconographies from each of its past wielders."
37,"A large reinforced hide sack containing specialized caltrops known as horse nails. The spikes are large enough to be avoided by human sized and smaller creatures without issue and are designed to drive a long, thin spike up into the foot of any heavy being that steps on it with more than 400 pounds of force. A single bag of horse nails will adequately cover a 10-foot by 10-foot area. Horse nails function similarly to caltrops except that they deal twice as much damage and will affect creatures normally immune to caltrops due to size, such as horses and giants with thick-soled shoes."
38,"A large round-headed hammer (Maul statistics) much like a common carpenter's mallet. Its only noteworthy feature is that it is made entirely from coal-black iron. Even the handle is cast in iron, patterned to imitate the grain of wood that would normally be used.  The hammer is quite heavy and seems over-balanced, but once held it is quickly apparent that it can be handled with ease and grace."
39,"A lavish rapier with a golden hand guard cast in the shape of a large three sailed ship."
40,"A leaf-bladed shortsword. It is perfectly balanced, and its edge glitters hungrily when it is wielded. Runic glyphs decorate the blade which shift and change subtly each time a new creature grasps the weapon. Knowledge PC's can discern that the markings are actually an archaic language, which tell of the current bearer's heritage, exploits and deeds."
41,"A long leather whip with a bronze cap and guard to its handle."
42,"A long scythe with a purple glowing blade and silver handle with decorated sculpted brass. The weapon emanates a strong aura of unease, visible as strangely moving smoke that falls from the blade."
43,"A long wooden staff that resembles a young oak sapling. It seems to be still growing despite not having leaves or a root system."
44,"A longbow made from a long, curving piece of exotic wood. The weapon is carved in the likeness of a serpent whose open maw and curved tail provide the hooks on which to string the bow."
45,"A longsword whose first quarter of the blade is curved forward like a fishhook. The hilt comes to a sharp point, and an outward pointing crescent blade serves as a hand guard and striking surface."
46,"A longbow made from the wood of a Luurden tree that grows in the Underdark. Insidious drow runes are inlaid up and down the limbs of the bow in dark silver, extracted from the mines of the Underdark."
47,"A longspear known as a duom with a standard spearhead as well as two blades curved so that they point backward along the shaft."
48,"A longsword set with a dark blue blade slightly glowing pinpricks as if seeing starlight far into the distance. The effect is similar to looking through a window into the night's sky, showing changing stars and constellations through the blade. Its soft beauty brings clarity to even the darkest of places and blinding light to the unfaithful. This blade exists as a reminder to those who serve evil, the stars shine brightest on the darkest of nights."
49,"A metal-bound hardwood quarterstaff, balanced and hardened for use in battle. Many acanists who find themselves in the thick of battle appreciate the heft of these not-terribly-subtle weapons."
50,"A military style quiver containing Resolve: {Roll 3d6+3} arrows of human make but elven design. Each arrow has a series of notches along it so that, when fired, it emits a distinctive series of notes. A unit of troops firing in sequence could create chords or even whole songs this way."
51,"A padded club consisting of a stout, oaken cudgel wrapped with a thick, woolen covering. This is an ideal weapon for a wielder who needs to rough someone up or take them alive. The club never outright kills its target and whenever the wielder would normally kill a creature with the club, the creature is just knocked out instead and is rendered unconscious and stable."
52,"A pair of daggers with wickedly curved blades, fashioned from a dark grey steel. They are identical save for the engraving on the pommel: one bears the silhouette of a cat, the other a stylized eye."
53,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ shined to a mirror polish, but only reflects images of its previous owners, in their moment of death."
54,"A powerful spring-loaded telescoping sword-cane with two small rubies inset into either side of the ornate gold-leaf covered handle. The cane can function as both a cane and a thin sword and sheath. Additionally, firmly pressing both rubies releases a spring, firing a crossbow bolt (See Note) out of the bottom of the cane with enough lethal force to travel at least 20 feet. The launcher functions by means of a tightly compressed spring and reloading the bolt takes a significant amount of time (One minute) twisting the handle clockwise to compress the spring once more. —Note: The attack roll is the same as if the wielder had fired a light crossbow."
55,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose metal shines like the sea itself, the white color reminds one of endless pearl necklaces. Instead of a hilt, a large piece of rope has been tied around the lower end. On the side of the blade there is an engraving: “Whoever sits in stillness may be able to break the silence”."
56,"A purple mace whose head is made of two large clam shells with a strange black pearl holding the shells together and to the handle."
57,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a blackened, wickedly hooked and barbed monstrosity of a blade that appears to be made of leather and flesh, and drips blood, but has no edge."
58,"A polearm known as a nagintav (Glaive statistics) with a long, curved blade set atop an eight-foot shaft. As it is an effective weapon against opponents at a distance but useless at close range, naginata practitioners are taught to keep their opponents at a distance by striking with quick, deliberate blows and then retreating."
59,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a simple blade without sheen or shine and a somewhat simple hilt, however the blade's scabbard is quite elegant. A crest sits at the head of the scabbard, depicting a silver tree beyond a doorway or arch, with black leather wrapped in a spiraling braided silver cord from top to bottom."
60,"A reinforced jute quiver containing Resolve: {Roll 3d4+3} war darts made of hollow bone, all covered with dozens of tiny holes near their tips. On a hit, the darts lodge themselves deeply into the target and begin to draining blood from the target's body out the tail end. When this occurs, at the start of the target's subsequent turns, he suffers an amount of damage equivalent to a dagger (1d4) until a creature forcibly removes the dart with an action equivalent to attacking (Which causes the target 1d4 damage) or a creature proficient in medicine spends an action equivalent to attacking to carefully remove it without further harming the target. These war darts are delicate and not recoverable after being thrown."
61,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with an ornate blade has a hilt of gold and finely etched scriptures all along its blade which promote chivalry and mercy."
62,"A quiver that is short and wide, allowing its arrows to spread out like a fan. The quiver has highly decorative ross-straps on the front held by circular fittings, and a triangular bottom plate. One side of the quiver is colored an ice blue with the other side is a fiery orange. The two colors meet in the middle into a gradient of purple. The quiver contains 20 arrows and knowledgeable PC's are aware that this distinctive style of quiver is only worn by the oathsworn archers that guard the imperial palace with their lives."
63,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with grooves carved along the blade that create haunting sounds at the wielder fights. This weapon was no doubt commissioned by practitioners of the more esoteric fighting styles that mix physical and psychological warfare into a singular type of combat training."
64,"A scimitar made of many silver crescent coins welded together."
65,"A reinforced quiver containing Resolve: {Roll 3d6+3} arrows with vicious, curved, back-hooks lining the head. These barbed arrows causes a great deal of pain and damage when removed as it digs into flesh."
66,"A sharp, curved scimitar designed for use by halflings who can turn their small size into a tactical melee advantage. Carvings of creeping ivy adorn the blade, organically complementing the entire weapon design. When swung in battle, it emits a chirp like a cricket."
67,"A shortspear designed for throwing, adorned with a needle-thin spike at its end that ensures it rarely gets trapped within an enemy's flesh or amour. Unlike many other spears, this spear has a leather strap for easy recovery. When thrown at a creature within 15 feet, the wielder can snatch the leather strap and thereby recover the weapon as an action equivalent to drawing a weapon."
68,"A shortsword of extraordinary quality, resembling a punching dagger in its design. The blade has a rusty color, but it otherwise appears newly forged. When swung in combat, tendrils of ectoplasmic energy trail behind the blade."
69,"A silver dagger shaped like a curved claw. The hilt is wrapped with dark blue silk."
70,"A silvery longsword with a razor thin yet broad blade that glints yellow in the sun. Its hand-and-a-half hilt is coated with gold and has an exorbitantly large, clear, cut quartz as the pommel."
71,"A shortsword with a black blade with one edge, a black leather hilt, and a chain from which a sharpened purple crystal hangs."
72,"A silvered dagger with a teal colored gem fitted into the base of the hilt that glimmers like the suns reflection in the water."
73,"A six foot long quarterstaff cast to resemble rough-hewn wood, despite the fact it is composed entirely of rusted iron."
74,"A slender, ivory-hilted stiletto."
75,"A longspear with a shaft of bloodwood and the grips and mounts of electrum. The “blade” is a sharpened alicorn."
76,"A solid stone greatclub of immense weight and heft. Intricate carvings spiral around its entire length, describing the dangers of the dreaming world beneath the sky."
77,"A slim and elegant dagger that resembles a miniature rapier with its long needle-like apex. Emblazoned in gold on the hilt is the symbol of a kingfisher."
78,"A staff of burnished white oak that's capped with silvered steel and engraved with runes and symbols of light."
79,"A sturdy wooden case lined with several inches of thick woolen batting that serves to protect the Resolve: {Roll 2d6+2} crossbow bolts in it from being jostled overmuch. These powerful and extremely dangerous alchemical bolts contain reactive agents that explode when they strike. On a hit, rather than the typical crossbow damage, these bolts deal three daggers worth of fire damage (3d4) to the struck target and all creatures within five feet of him. Because of their awkward shape and weight, the range increment of these exploding bolts are reduced by half."
80,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ of black iron as sharp as steel, in the shape of a stylized dragon's wing. The cutting edge of the sword being the leading edge of the wing."
81,"A two foot long shortsword possessing a slightly curved blade, its handle is made of bone (The femur of an aquatic elf) and is covered with a scrimshaw like carving. The carvings depict creatures of water such as octopi, whales, even a walrus. Also a carving of a sinister looking reptile and human hybrid of some sorts. An Identify spell will reveal the name of the sword, which is the same as its creator; one Jonas Harkness a sailor who by the end of his life had a deep abiding hatred for the sea."
82,"A greatsword of brightly polished steel, with gold wire-wrapped hilt and blade inlaid down the rib with panels of garnet set in a tongue of copper."
83,"A vicious scrimshawed weapon known as a Kaua'koi (See Note), fashioned from a large length of bone harvested from an enormous creature. Several hand-notches are carved all over the bone, while the rest is sculpted into spurs, blades and polished nodules. Fighting with a kaua'koi is a high art, involving constantly switching grips to make the most of this versatile weapon. In many tribes, carving one's own kaua'koi is a rite of passage —Note: Greatclub statistics but the wielder can choose to deal either piercing slashing or bludgeoning damage each time he attacks."
84,"A warhammer that is much more solid than the majority of bludgeons the bearer has seen. The sides of its blocky head are adorned in silver inlays. When held by the handle the wielder feels a weight comes upon him as if he gained a great responsibility. Whenever the weapon is grasped, a warning flows into the bearer's mind as if whispered in his ear. “Those who are not willing to bear the burden are not worthy to wield me”."
85,"A well-crafted fan constructed of iron spines covered with silk, decorated with an elaborate landscape on one side and animal motifs on the reverse. Known as an iron fan (Dagger statistics), they are reasonably common in some noble courts serving as both accessory and subtle protection. Most attacks are thrusts to the vitals made when the fan is closed, though the universally intricate and graceful fan forms teach practitioners to open and close their fans with a quick flick of the wrist, the loud snap serving as a distraction to opponents. Onlookers are not immediately aware that the fan can be used as a weapon and anyone attempting to discern if the fan is lethal suffers disadvantage on their check to do so, though a physical inspection renders it immediately apparently. Once used in combat, the silk becomes too torn and bloody to pass as innocuous and requires costly replacing with either more silk or colored paper which will cost about 1d4+1 X 5 gold pieces."
86,"A wickedly barbed longspear carved out of a solid piece of bone. It's decorated with coral, pearls, and sapphires. Flowing Aquan script runs the length of the spear, detailing its history and wielders stretching back thousands of years. Anytime the bearer grips the weapon's haft, he can hear the sound of the ocean. Knowledgeable PC's can determine that the notched spear was crafted thousands of years ago from the rib of an enormous sea serpent."
87,"A wickedly sharp and multi-bladed dagger. This weapon is well balanced for throwing in a horizontal fashion, where its multiple blades can cause serious wounds upon any target."
88,"A wide-headed, flanged mace with an abnormally long handle, inlaid with ebony wood and silver."
89,"An arcane quarterstaff made of wood that is either naturally black or was stained that way by someone who knew what they were doing. Its length is covered with gold inscriptions which might be in some variant dialect of illegible Draconic but is more likely to be impressive-looking nonsense. The narrow bottom end has an elaborate metallic spike on useful for traveling as well as fighting. The staff's head displays a stylized depiction of a watchful dragon curled around a massive, rough crystal. Despite its ornate and delicate appearance, it can be wielded in combat as well as any mace without even damaging its lacquered finish."
90,"An arrow case crafted from woven rattan that narrows to a hard tip at the bottom end. The case may be stabbed into the ground allowing the archer easier access to the arrows. The case contains Resolve: {Roll 3d6+3} arrows with willow-leaf arrowheads designed to tear up flesh and create grisly wounds. Wide-bodied and razor-sharp, the arrows rarely penetrates deeply into the body but always create long, ugly lacerations when striking a target."
91,"An elegant, lustrous longsword of slender make that has seen a hundred battles and carries the enmity of countless tortured souls."
92,"An immense greatsword whose massive five-foot-long blade is capable of cutting foes to pieces with relative ease."
93,"A steel tipped heavy pick, its haft decorated with ebony calf figurines, overlaid with gold."
94,"An elaborately-carved, thick, wooden baton (club statistics) that sheaths a pair of matching slender bladed daggers. Each handle has a slot near the blade that serves as a sheath for its twin and when the blades are sheathed the handles form the sturdy baton. These thin stiletto blades as commonly referred to as tamo daggers and are typically carried by spies, nobles and assassins who want to carry weapons without looking like they are doing so. The baton could easily pass as a rod of office or military officer's baton and it would take an impressively perceptive creature to notice the break in the middle where the daggers sheath together."
95,"A quarterstaff that still has its bark on it except for where a long serpentine dragon twists around it, carefully carved, sanded, and oiled to a sheen."
96,"An unwieldy primitive weapon that takes the form of a huge and heavy cleaver mounted on the end of a two-foot shaft. The shortspear deals wide slashing strikes capable of causing horrific injuries on a well-placed blow."
97,"A sickle sword (Bastard sword statistics) favored by those with no talent for witchcraft, this exotic blade curves multiple times along its three and a half feet. The sickle-sword's hilt is long and curved, and its blade bears a small secondary grip partway up its length. These allow a wielder with a free hand to rapidly twist the sword in unpredictable ways."
98,"A whip made out of thick but flexible rope meant to be used for taming reasons. Its business end sports tiny, sharp thorns, which inflict dozens of small painful wounds over a wide area."
99,"A set of nunchaku (Club statistics) fashioned from the right arm-bones of a human, bound with sinew at the elbow joint."
100,"A watertight, gnomish made, waxed leather quiver containing Resolve: {Roll 3d6+3} crossbow bolts that knowledgeable PC's will recognize as Dragonsbreath Bolts. Each piece of ammunition has a shaft soaked in resin or pitch and a slightly enlarged head filled with a dab of alchemist's fire. Slots in the head force air into the chamber when the bolts is fired, igniting the alchemist's fire and the shaft as well. The slots in the head emit a low screech as the projectile flies through the air. A Dragonsbreath Bolt deals an additional dagger's worth of fire damage (1d4) when it hits a target, and a flammable unattended target such as a thatched roof or a spilled vial of oil automatically catches fire. A Dragonsbreath Bolt cannot be reused on miss or hit. The dollop of alchemical explosive has a nasty habit of going off for no reason and whenever the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll while using them, the bolt lights up in the wielder's hand dealing a dagger's worth of fire damage (1d4) to him."
