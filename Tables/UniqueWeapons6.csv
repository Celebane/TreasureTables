1,"A large-hafted maul that ends in a spiked head. Stained black from the blood of thousands of victims, it seems alive with violence. Any who bears this weapon for too long finds their thoughts ever drifting towards carnage and bloodshed, eventually finding themselves obeying the weapon's desires."
2,"A tool of murder made entirely out of carved with black, blasphemous runes along its length. When used to kill a creature that has a soul, the ^AllRandomWeaponTables^ shines with an unholy light, briefly opening a sliver sized gate into the Abyss, allowing the foul whispering of demons to seep through for a moment before resealing."
3,"A knight's lance carved from the heartwood of an ancient oak that was shattered by lighting. Its blackened wood is covered with tiny carvings depicting the twelve major battles that defined the existence of an order of holy paladins. Despite being harder than stone and diamond sharp, it is lightweight and beautiful to behold."
4,"A longsword with a long and narrow blade, pointed and double-edged with a modest hilt. The sword is aquamarine in colour, and its name “Glory Goat” has been etched on the base of the blade in an arcane script. If the blade touches any other, a strange sound reverberates from the sword, a cry, that goes on, and on. The effect is cumulative, persistent, and sounds like a dying goat, no doubt giving the sword its name."
5,"A jet black katana with black silk cloth wrapped around where the hilt and guard should be."
6,"An executioner's greatsword with a hilt a conventional cruciform shape and a large counter-balancing pommel. The sword is well constructed with high-quality steel used for the manufacture of the weapon. The base of the blade is decorated with symbolic designs, showing instruments of execution and torture. Etched along the length of the flats of the blade is the inscription “When I Raise This Sword, So I Wish That This Poor Sinner Will Receive Eternal Life”."
7,"A longbow that bears a gnarled and twisted appearance that belies the uncanny precision of which it is capable."
8,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that appears to be made entirely of throbbing flesh, with veins dancing just under its foul skin. Whenever blocked or parried, the weapon lets loose a horrific shriek and bleeds. The weapon is utterly repulsive to maintain and profoundly disturbing to polish, oil or sharpen."
9,"A fleet admiral's rapier with a golden hand guard, fashioned to look like a large three sailed ship."
10,"A saber (Shortsword, longsword or scimitar, DM's choice), with a faintly curved and razor sharp blade on the edge which is sharp rather far on the back. It has a point as deadly as a rapier and the curve is not enough to keep it from being used for thrust and counter as well as chopping away meat-axe style. The guard sports a bell-curved back around the knuckles into a semi-basket but cut away enough to permit full moulinet from any guard. It balanced in the forte less than two inches from the guard, yet the blade is heavy enough to chop bone. The grips is honest sharkskin and molds to the hand and the sword feels like an extension of the wielder's body. The weapon is exquisitely balanced and the blade sports faint ripples left by the feather-soft hammerblows of some master swordsmith. There rests a motto chased on to the blade, buried in curlicues that reads; “While We Live, Let Us Live!”"
11,"A large katana with a dark-forged blade and a golden guard. The handle has classical silk wrapping with black decorations and an octagonal guard. The blade features several intricate ornaments, most notable is a relief of a dragon at the endpoint of the hilt. The scabbard is black, made of traditional lacquered wood, and bears metallic adornments on its far end."
12,"A rune-marked ^RandomSwordTable^ forged between the skulls of two weeping scholars, and tempered in the flames of their treasured and forbidden books. The vast knowledge and wisdom of the learned men and their tomes are contained within the weapon, safely locked away. The wielder always feels as though they should be able to access the information but that the wellspring of intellect is always just out of reach, like a word permanently stuck on the tip of his tongue."
13,"A warhammer whose head was forged from a silver metal that shines with bluish highlights. Its sides are adorned with carved dwarven symbols and its oaken haft bears precise scrollwork. The wood is highly polished, and the deep rich grain shows through the finish."
14,"The ^RandomSwordTable^'s curved blade is deeply etched with epithets and curses against the dwarfish race, and each engraving is filled with the dried blood of countless stout folk."
15,"A plain warhammer that lacks any sort of decoration whatsoever. The weapons is oddly unbalanced, the majority of its weight held in its thick, stone head. The handle is rough to the touch, making the hammer somewhat painful to hold in the wielder's bare hands."
16,"A magnificent ^RandomSwordTable^ whose grip and scabbard are encrusted with pearls. The sword shines dimly with its own inner light and the blade shimmers as if water is constantly flowing down its length."
17,"A wakizashi (Short sword statistics) with an unremarkable blade that shines dully in the light. The hilt is carved of jade and wrapped with brass and gold wire, while the tsuba bears the simple carving of a fine palace of an imperial city."
18,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a hilt and guard of simple design. Both they and the blade are usually golden in color, but when the weapon is used in combat it throbs blood red."
19,"A glaive with a sharp sword-like blade that ends in a point. The blade is encased by a golden circle that resembles the sun and has outward facing spikes to catch and cut the wielder's enemies."
20,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a carved golden handle and guard, resting in a purple and blue textured scabbard. The blade exuded a sense of creeping unease to any who view it, and those who wield it find their dreams haunted by poor decisions from their past and sins they committed against those they loved and served."
21,"A maul with a heavy iron business end shaped in the form of a snarling wolf's head."
22,"A blood-red ^RandomSwordTable^ that pulses with a life of its own and thrums with energy. Whenever block or parried, the blade sprays blood as if injured."
23,"A scimitar with a single edged, lightweight blade that allows for impressive displays of speed and accuracy in the hands of a skilled fighter. The camel leather grip of the weapon is stamped with the symbol of a well-respected guild of nomadic traders."
24,"A well made ^RandomSwordTable^ whose most distinguishing feature is a message from the swordsmith to the wielder that is etched into the flats of the blade. A mixture of a warning and an apology, it is signed not with a name but with the smith's maker's mark. The message reads, “There is no safety to be found in a sword. A sword brings death. It does not give life. It is a responsibility, a burden. This is no gift, it is a curse. I hope one day you will forgive me.”."
25,"A katana with a blade forged from meteorite with a hilt and cross guard of shaped, dragon scale. The scabbard is cut from obsidian, polished to a dark shine and tipped with an etched silver cap. A long, thick ribbon of crimson fabric hangs from the end of hilt."
26,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose mottled, serrated blade is engraved with words of power in the dark tongue, keeping its biting edge keen and sharp for all time."
27,"A handaxe with a charcoal colored wooden handle in the shape of an “S”. The axe head is jet black with a fine saw-tooth edge."
28,"A pale ^RandomSwordTable^ that's crude but sharp, made entirely from a single piece of material. Although clearly not metallic, the substance is unidentifiable and is perhaps the bone or ivory of an unknown creature."
29,"A bog standard infantry soldier's shortsword that's utterly unremarkable except for a military creed etched into the grip. The handle reads “This Is My Sword, There Are Many Like It But This One's Mine.”."
30,"A thin, jagged shortsword favored by the orc reavers who terrorize the fishermen and traders of the northern coasts. Most orkish cutlasses don't last long, as the jagged edges and constant exposure to sea-spray cause the steel to rust. As such, many orc reavers carry two or three on raids."
31,"A matte black bandolier holding a dozen kunai. The black throwing daggers are about the length of a man's hand, with grips wrapped in white bandages and circular ends to which ribbons or paper messages can be attached."
32,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a fairly long and thin blade with a rectangular hand-guard and a wooden hilt wrapped in bandages."
33,"A bastard sword with a wide, flat blade with two curved indentations near its base, creating a sort of cross-guard. The overall sword looks like a flounder fish in shape and although perfectly serviceable, it's not particularly intimidating."
34,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a slate grey blade with a circular, hollow, pommel and a fairly long grip. A chain connects the pommel to the hilt of the sword which is joined to the blade. The wide blade itself has several markings resembling veins running down its length."
35,"An enameled mace that resembles a conch shell with numerous sharp protrusions all over its surface and a marking in the center that resembles an eye. Its hilt is wrapped in bandages which cover a dozen more eye-shaped markings."
36,"A vile ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade was forged over a fire of starving souls. Its edges are worked into a thousand tiny mouths, each studded with spiny teeth and rasping tongues. When it strikes a creature, its vitality is drained away and the victim is rocked by the nearness and fragility of their own mortality."
37,"A pair of shortswords each with slim and straight double-edged blades. Both blades also have an upward-curved bladed prong near the tip of one side of the blade and another one near the base of the blade's other side. At their bases are smooth brown hilts with a round grey pommels. The blades rest in a double mouthed leather scabbard that allows the bearer to easily draw both swords in combat situations."
38,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ that was quenched in the blood of brave and noble men, and washed with the tears of their lovers. The weapon fills the wielder with a sense of physical immunity and power, as if no harm could ever befall him."
39,"A large fullblade, as tall as a full-grown man, shaped like a butcher knife. The blade itself has two cut outs, a circle close to the top and a semi-circular one nearer to the handle, the former of which is aptly fitting the sword's purpose of severing enemy limbs and necks. The latter notch allows a strap to be wrapped around the weapon, making it easier for the bearer to carry. Its extremely long handle is also detachable to further aid transportation and then reattached when required for combat."
40,"A disgusting ^RandomSwordTable^ that features a pommel and hilt made from the ribs and still-living heart of a failed servant of evil. The wielder is filled with a sense of impunity as though they will never be held accountable for their actions, no matter how perverse."
41,"A crude club fashioned from the rib bone of a demon and still reeks of brimstone and fresh blood."
42,"A black ^AllRandomWeaponTables^ that seems to be a sliver of the night's sky splattered with sparkling motes of light. A creature damaged by the weapon is filled with the sorrow that each dawn brings the light of the sun that burns away the subtle twinklings of the stars."
43,"A ^AllRandomWeaponTables^ that was infused with the powdered remains of a profoundly good and noble creature during its crafting. Eerily, instead of being twisted and evil, this weapon is somehow virtuous and holy. The bearer is filled with inspiration to make the world a better place."
44,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose hollowed blade appears to be made of glass, and within it rests a pale blue fluid. When drawn, the fluid begins to bubble, and an eerie song emits from the weapon."
45,"A slender ^RandomSwordTable^ that features a living eye in the center of the crosspiece. It is a shifty, canny eye that leers out at its wielder, seemingly staring into the bearer's very soul."
46,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade is pitted and scratched, flawed with numerous notches and dings. Its cutting edge is still sharp however and will kill your enemies just as dead as a weapon that looks a hundred times more aesthetically pleasing."
47,"A warhammer with a head consisting of a trapezoidal-shaped slab of iron with runic designs swirled across the metal and a stubby handle bound in leather. When used in combat, the bearer's nostrils are filled with the scent of thunderstorms and his skin feels the tingling of far of lighting."
48,"An implement of battle that is heavy, strong and covered in an oily sheen. The ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ seems to have a rhythmic pulse akin to a beating heart."
49,"A longsword with a skull-shaped pommel and a large dusky ruby embedded in the skull's mouth."
50,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose metal blade feels heavy and unstable, as if it's filled with liquid. When examined closely, the metal casts distorted and twisted reflections."
51,"A large and blood spattered greataxe with many charms and pouches chained to its haft. The weapon has the name “Foe Killer” carved into its length."
52,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade is jagged and splintered, having been forged on an anvil of ice, unheated in an un-flame of frost, and then quenched in a pool of liquid fire."
53,"A steel bastard sword with a rather plain, silver pommel, sheathed in an ivory scabbard. The weapon seemed to be designed to be as inconspicuous as possible but under magical detection, it emits a faint aura of divination magic. sigils"
54,"A ^RandomSwordTable^fashioned from black iron chased with brass and decorated in crimson runes. Strangely, it casts a red shadow."
55,"A heavy mace with a shaft carved from shadow-wood that had been engraved with necromantic icons formed by deep red silkstone and tiger eye agate."
56,"A ^RandomSwordTable^whose blade has a rotten and putrescent appearance, as if forged from solid corruption and foulness. When it strikes a foe, it leaves a little something of itself behind, causing the wounds to seep pus and attract blowflies."
57,"A steel rapier with the etched motif of a small bird along the base of the blade, and a pair of silver wings that shapes the guard."
58,"A ^RandomSwordTable^forged by the heat of the immolated and cooled in their ashes. The sword has a smoky grey sheen and mutters and gibbers when swung. Before the foul weapon was complete, the craftsman drenched the blade in a soup made from the venom of a thousand spiders. The blade's metal still seems to crawl as if covered with thousands of flat metallic spiders."
59,"A battleaxe with a black metal haft as long as a man's arm and a set of double heads shaped like wings of a butterfly. Silver runes are inscribed along the length of the haft and the blades edges are as sharp as a shaving-knife. The bearer of the weapon senses that it possesses a brutal legacy of blood and death."
60,"A ^RandomSwordTable^whose blade has a brassy sheen riddled with streaks of crimson. Arcane glyphs glow along the length of the blade, filling its wielder with self-assurance and confidence."
61,"A long bronze scimitar that glows with a weird, greenish aura and produces boiling wisps of vapor that reek of a hot, sour odor even from across a room."
62,"An abominable ^RandomSwordTable^fashioned from a fused human vertebra bound into a single mass by foul sorceries. Bristling along the edges of the blade are teeth harvested from children and sharped to deadly precision."
63,"A pirate's cutlass (Shortsword, longsword or scimitar, DM's choice) whose blade is etched with a scaled pattern and a hilt wrapped in sharkskin."
64,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ that's entirely made from a queer white metal forged from the despair of those who cannot die, and cleansed with the prayers of those afraid of death. At times the blade seems to dissolve, becoming no more than a wisp of smoke."
65,"A considerably heavy maul that bears the image of a mountain with a crack running from tip to base on each side."
66,"A foul, twisted ^RandomSwordTable^ that contains the insane mind of a berserker, bound there when the sword was quenched in his blood. During combat the wielder can feel the battle frenzy of the trapped spirit and the soul's undying rage fills the wielder with primal, violent, savagery."
67,"A greatsword with a leather-wrapped grip that feels warm and comfortable to the hand. The pommel, a simple polished steel oval, serves as a counterweight to the long blade, which is double-edged and rounded at the tip, more for hacking than stabbing. Down the center of the blade, a wide groove is emblazoned with pagan icons that shimmer in a lighter shade of silver, as if they'd been inlaid while the blade was forged"
68,"A dark ^RandomSwordTable^ forged from stygian iron that sucks away portions of its victim's essence with each strike. The weapon is as black as a nightmare and truly frightening to behold. It glows with a faintly sinister purple light if it has recently ended a creature's life."
69,"A war scythe whose blade curves like a crescent moon and sports a thick handle wrapped in leather. The honed edge of the weapon is free of any nick or dent and the polished flat of the blade can be used as a mirror."

71,"A well-used ^RandomSwordTable^ which bears the inscription “Let The Stars Die And Mankind End Before This Sword Returns Unblooded To Its Sheath.“ along the flat of its blade. The inscription seems to drink in any blood and gore that directly covers the words allowing the message to always be visible to its wielder."
72,"A shortsword made of translucent glassteel imbued with diamond dust, causing it to sparkle in the faintest light. The hilt is black metal formed like a spider web while the pommel resembles an arachnid's head, with two dull emeralds for its eyes."
73,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose grip bears the inscription “Strength From Wrath” which proclaims both a prayer to the God of Battle and a directive to the wielder."
74,"A light crossbow whose wooden and metal components are completely covered in engraved prayers or rage and zeal."
75,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a long, feather-shaped blade over a handle with several blue spheres encrusted within it and two feather-like ornaments near the base of the blade."
76,"A dagger with a black colored grip curved at the end and a similarly colored guard, that is engraved with simple pictographs of the five elements. The blade is curved and decorated at the base."
77,"A stately ^RandomSwordTable^ with a hilt made of gold, carved into the shape of a lion. The body, rear legs and tail made up handle and pommel, with its forelegs and front paws forming the crossguard. The head of the lion had open jaws, with diamond-encrusted mithral teeth set into the groove of the blade, which extended from the gaping maw. Two rubies were inset within the lion's eyes."
78,"An ancient looking trident made of brass and oak. It drips with a continuous flow of seawater, and is always covered in bits of coral, seaweed and barnacles. Neither this detritus nor the water make it slippery to hold, however."
79,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade is apparently made only of darkness. Its shape is a tangible black void, outlined in a crimson streak which is the source of the blade's light. It crackles like lightning when drawn, and creates a sharp buzzing sound when swung, like that of an angry bee. Oddly, when the blade strikes a foe, there is no sound from the hit, despite the strength behind it."
80,"A cutlass (Shortsword, longsword or scimitar, DM's choice) of ancient design, the weapon is surprisingly light. The blade does not appear to be made of metal, save for the hilt, and its cutting edge was comprised of a material resembling a dull, matte onyx. Its elaborate hilt was carved to resemble a keelhauled sailor."
81,"A finely crafted greatsword forged of cold iron and gold, with a lion motif. The cross guard is shaped like lion's paws, and where it meets the blade at the rain guard rests an image of a lion's head, in profile on one side, face-on on the other. The hilt was bound in white leather and gold wire. Set into the pommel was a large, brilliant-cut white diamond, circled by five rectangular fiery yellow corundums. The cold iron blade was tinted with gold, with the words “Seek the High Seat Always” written in the Celestial language etched on both sides."
82,"A ^AllRandomWeaponTables^ whose sculpted surface flickers with unknown energies which paint glittering arcs of destruction as it is swung. The weapon leaves hideously gaping, yet bloodless wounds as the flesh where it strikes simply dissolves into oily smoke and immediately cauterizes."
83,"A greatsword crafted from a single piece of high-grade steel. The weapon is completely unadorned, the cross guard, hilt and pommel are all bare metal with the heavy blade counter-balanced by a solid pentagonal prism marked by angular edges and featureless faces. The hilt had been cross-hatched and scored to provide a grip, and the cross guard had been stamped with the simple numeral “7” across its breadth."
84,"A relic longsword of a barely remembered era, the weapon is exquisite and perfectly weighted. The sword has a starmetal blade, as well as a wraithbonegrip and it is inscribed with the entire tale of the fall of the Eldar race. As the wielder of the storied sword fights, they find their mind filling with images of that terrible time, which drives them into a killing fury and makes the wielder determined to prevent such terrible events from transpiring to the Eldar ever again."

87,"A longspear with a blade in the shape of an elongated tear cut with a hollow in the center, representing a single drop of blood. Glittering with an inner light, the spearhead rests atop a sculpted haft that shows the angel of blood, clad in the monastic vestments of a high priest. The celestial's perfect face is lost in a voluminous hood and its mighty angel wings spread against the air. Below that rests a single purity seal that bears the personal mark of the Angel of Divine Vengeance."
88,"A longsword whose crossguard resembles the glowering visage of a wolf with eyes of ruby that gleam hungrily. Whenever the weapon is used in combat, the wielder can hears the faint howling of wolves in the distance."
89,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose blade is alive with hate, creating dizzying patterns of dark, angry colours that constantly swirl along the length of the strange steel. When it pierces flesh, the weapon twists and turns in the wound of its own accord, viciously creating pain and suffering for its own sake."
90,"A silver and green shortbow, lightweight and elegant, filling the bearer with an energetic sense of purpose when wielded."
91,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose once finely-wrought tempered steel, has been blackened, corroded and despoiled by the foul sigils carved into it. The blade pulses with sickly green light and totems of dried rats' skulls and shriveled human hands had been bound to the haft with knotted leather cords"
92,"A lightweight scimitar adorned with a bright golden handle. The blade is patterned with winding snakes."
93,"A long-handled hammer crafted from black iron. When seen from the one's peripheral vision, the viewer is absolutely certain that demonic yellow eyes open up across the weapon's length and stare into their soul."
94,"A purple and brown ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that cackles maniacally when swung. Inlaid along its length are the knucklebones of a dozen raving lunatics. It is rumored that a truly striking blow from this weapon can drive a victim somewhat insane but most victims are usually rendered dead by wounds that serious anyway, so the stories have yet to be confirmed."
95,"A dwarven maul with a solid iron head, with gold inlay and a deep dark wooden handle, inscribed with dwarven runes."
96,"A greatsword whose blade is decorated with an imprint of a serpentine dragon. Inscribed near the hilt is the phrase “Hear My Roar” in Draconic."
97,"A banded leather quiver filled with two dozen silver-tipped arrows fletched with owl feathers that make no sound upon impact."
98,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ whose stygian black blade doesn't reflect light. The guard is made of silver wings that covering the handle and its pommel ends in the design of a raven's talon grasping a clear round gemstone."
99,"A weighty two handed mace whose shaft is carved from the thighbone of a dragon and its bulbous head wrought from meteoric iron."
100,"A silvery battleaxe that glitters in the sun, showing its beautiful etchings and engravings of powerful warriors slaughtering women, children, and the elderly. When held, the weapon almost tugs at the hand and mind, seeking blood, and will not be sated by anything short of killing."
