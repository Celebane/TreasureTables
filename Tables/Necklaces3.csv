1,"An ornate necklace with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it. The star is impressively cut; its six rays reached right around the polished hemisphere, and their intersection floats just above the surface."
2,"A small, crudely made vine necklace with a locket made of hardened mushroom. Within the locket rests a glowing green seal made of soft moss that represents a proud guardian of the natural cycle or one who has sold her soul to darkness for eternal life, depending on the observer's point of view. Knowledgeable PC's will know that the symbol belongs to an influential guild known as the Golgari Swarm. The guild is the embodiment of life and death and the teeming masses of the Swarm believe that both are natural and equally essential too. To them, life and death are natural elements of a cycle with no intermediary break. A locket like this is usually given to those who have performed amazing feats for the Swarm."
3,"An amber disk carved in deep relief on one side, its edge guarded by a hoop of gold, the whole thing strung on a golden chain. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize the object as the official seal of the abbess of a remote convent of militant nuns."
4,"A uniquely designed onyx amulet with a pattern of raised curving line on the front surrounding a central dome. On the back of the object have been inscribed a few calligraphed lines that form either a poem or a warning. “Mindless rage will shake the world, Cunning lies will bend it. Reckless haste will break the world, And into darkness send it.”"
5,"A misshapen amulet that appears to represent some sort of weird… thing. It's impossible to get a good grasp of its exact shape or dimensions, and its geometry may not be entirely euclidean. Attempting prolonged gazes at the eldritch object or studying it in detail produces headaches, fleeting visions of alien hellscapes and temporary short term memory loss."
6,"A pretty necklace consisting of a sapphire strung on a silver chain. On close inspection, an observer can tell the gemstone has a pocked of air trapped within it. Knowledgeable PC's will know that this phenomenon is known as an inclusion and is used in some circles as a ward against curses. The pendant smells of juniper, broom and aspen."
7,"A hexagonal, purple crystalline stick with an indent at the bottom that hides a pattern of raised notches. The top has an enclosing eye-hook with a string, making it a decorative necklace that may double as a key."
8,"A boar shaped amulet, made from the tusk of a wild pig."

12,"A sculpted oak pendant inset with a stone of teardrop-shaped marble."
13,"A medallion that appears to be made of barely  contained, pure magic.

21,"A wooden necklace in the shape of an inverted pentagram that becomes extremely warm to the touch when exposed to fresh blood."
22,"A necklace bearing a small pendant made from 1000 year bog oak. The jewelry serves as a literal shard of history, as the wood was naturally pickled and preserved over many centuries. The oak has compressed and darkened, becoming as hard as a stone as it's slowly been fossilized. Traces of silver have grown into the cracks and crevices, contrasting with the now blackened wood and accentuates its aged surface detail. The silvery, stony wood is set on a base plate of copper."
23,"A large bone medallion in which is carved the image of a black cat standing silhouetted on a droughted grass hilltop, staring up at swarms of blood-red crows undulating in an ever-darkening sky. A creature who stares directly at the grisly scene feels a sense of dread overcome them and sees the world as a dimmer and scarier place until they break eye contact with the carving."
24,"A fine, unassuming silver chain, bearing a single arrowhead shaped jewel. While worn, it stirs thoughts of legendary battles and heroic deeds."

46,"A toadstone, brown, nearly circular, wrapped in dull lead wire. A loop is spun into the wire, and a new leather thong is tied through the loop, allowing it to be worn as a pendant. A symbol is carved on the stone's bottom; that of a curled, bat-winged serpent."
47,"An amulet of invocation made of copper, stamped with the symbol of the ancient druidic rune for winter. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize the pendant as proof of membership of The Pale Brotherhood of Eternal Winter a sinister organization that once invoking the presence of Laphela, the Marchioness of Cursed, the Dread Succubus to further their goal of cold misery across the world."

About a fourth of the pendant is covered with a band of many small green sprouts working their way out of the cracks in the old wood, while the rest is warped, dry, and remarkably aged.

If observed over the course of a lunar month, the sprouts continually shrink back and grow anew, the band revolving slowly around the pendant's surface."
