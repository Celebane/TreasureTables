This allows the bearer to better blend in with the locals of a foreign land and grants advantage on all social checks to convince another creature that the bearer's mother tongue is the one he is currently speaking or that is is a local of the same region as the other creature. The ring can also copy social accents, allowing the bearer to swear like a seasoned sailor, speak in the quick clipped tones of a thief or enunciate their words like a posh noble, in order to better blend in with the people around him. The bearer must be able to understand the language spoken and be able to speak it himself in order for the ring's magic to function. The bearer retains the ability to speak in such a manner for 24 hours after hearing the accent and can retain any number of different accents, dialects or slang."

No amount of close inspection reveals anything that stands out, nor any signs that this is anything more than it appears. At any sign of mirth near the Antagonist, the stone ball begins howling at an ever-increasing intensity until it completely drowns out the sounds of amusement. The noise is uniquely irritating to all who hear it and no creature finds the sound bearable let alone tolerable. The screeching continues for 30 seconds after the ending of any laughter, guffawing, chortling, giggling or chuckling within earshot. Knowledgeable PC's will know this objects like these are used to break the spirits and moral of creatures held in prisons, torture chambers and some strict religious orders."

Its body is covered with an array of blades and thorns, including a large upward curving thorn on its chest, a curving blade on its forehead and rosettes of thorns around its limb joints. Its eyes are multi-faceted and give off a vivid red glow and its mouth contains multiple rows of sharp metal teeth. Knowledge creatures will recognize it as a figure of myth and legends known as The Shrike, a being of incredible power, strength and dauntingly physical appearance. According to legend, The Shrike takes his victims to another plane where it impales its victims on a vast chrome tree covered in meter long thorns, known as the Tree of Pain, where they do not die but suffer in agony for eternity. Although it is rumored to have taken countless creatures in this manner, no two legends have the same reason as to its motivations, the source of its power or how its victims are chosen."
