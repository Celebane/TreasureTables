The night's sky seems to show more miniature towers upside down in the night's sky with the lights from their tips glowing like stars. On the back of the painting in a corner is written, “There's always a lighthouse. There's always a man. There's always a city” in elegant feminine script."
4,"A long, white banner which seems to be made of a single piece, neither woven, nor dyed, nor painted. A figure like a serpent, scaled in scarlet and gold, runs the entire length. It has scaled legs, feet with five long, golden claws on each, and a great head with a golden mane and eyes like the sun. The banner blows strongly in the slightest breeze and the stirring of the banner make the dragon seem to move as if alive. The banner folds up into a compact square and never becomes stained or dirtied."
5,"A thick candle that when lit, fills the air with the smell of hot bacon and eggs"

The challenge of the puzzle is to drink from the vessel in such a way that the beverage does not spill. To do this successfully, the cups must be drunk from in a specific order.

The vessel rests on a polished steel frame containing a candle whose heat and light are channeled into the bottom of the glass where the wax rests. The warmed wax rises through the surrounding liquid, cools, loses its buoyancy, and falls back to the bottom of the vessel in a cycle that is visually suggestive of lava, hence the commonly associated name of the lamp."

It consists of a wax mixture of a deep red color inside a conical glass vessel, the remainder of which contains a light blue translucent liquid. The vessel rests on a black iron frame with the very base decorated as a beach scene. The frame containing a candle whose heat and light are channeled into the bottom of the glass where the wax rests. The warmed wax rises through the surrounding liquid, cools, loses its buoyancy, and falls back to the bottom of the vessel in a cycle. While the lamp is lit the entire structure bears a striking resemblance to an active volcano."
88,"A clear glass bottle of Habushu, a type of rice wine which contains a preserved pit viper. The snake's intestines and many other internal organs have been removed but it's poison glad mix with the strong alcohol to induce a particularly intense drunken haze.

The plants have been magically enchanted to remain fresh and healthy, they never wilt or fade.

It's probably some sort of artistic statement on the pain of beauty or love."
97,"A leather travel case containing a short bow, 15 feet of strong silk line and a half dozen specialized arrows. The butts of the arrows lack any kind of feathering and instead have a set of loops made to attach the silk line. The arrowheads themselves are not standards flat blades but are steel headed points with four barbs that aim back towards the wielder. The arrows resemble small harpoons more than anything else.

99,"A glass cube that replays in graphic detail the bearer's worst memory when held for longer than one minute."

The plaque says that during the siege of castle Châlus by the invading King Richard (Who is described as a warlord who had devastated the nearby lands with fire and sword) a young cook stood on the edge of the castle walls. The boy, not quite yet a man held a crossbow in one hand and a frying pan in the other. The cook fended off stray arrows with his makeshift shield as he lined as target in his sights. King Richard, who was known to take walks unarmored at the edges of the various sieges he lead locked eyes with the boy and applauded his courage. The cook's aim was true and his bolt found a new quiver in the king's neck, ending the siege and a reign of terror.  It's a moving story, however the bolt in question is nowhere to be found, although there is a rectangular depression in the plaque where a glass case or display piece should be placed."
