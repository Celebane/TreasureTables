1,"A one gallon cask of Madman's Mead, an ash flavored brew that when downed, causes the drinker to black out for one minute and experience a Random Nightmare."
2,"A ten sided stone die, etched on each face with alchemical symbols representing different elements."
3,"A wash-leather pouch containing a narrow-gauge steel chain two feet in length covered with small teeth links and long braided hemp handles on either end of it. Known as a pocket chain saw, the user simply throws the chain over a branch, holds the hemp loops and pulls back and forth on each end of the chain. It can cut through two feet of soft wood or one foot of hard wood per minute. The chain weighs only a few ounces and easily fits in a pocket, making it extremely valuable for travelers."
4,"A translucent green jade statue of a small dragon, lounging like a cat. The dragon can hold a stick of incense in its paws and the ashes fall along its belly."
5,"A tiny puzzle box covered with over a hundred tiny panels; each can be manipulated to slide in any of four direction, presumably to open the lock. One side has been forced open and the contents removed, but the craftsmanship is still remarkable. It could be repaired by someone skilled in tinker's or locksmithing tools."
6,"An extremely efficient shovel made from the claw of a Xorn."
7,"A round, flat stone, always smooth and cool to the touch. It is covered in uneven wavy stripes of black and white. Watching the rock for more than a few moments will reveal that these stripes are moving slowly, undulating and rippling over the surface of the stone."
8,"A silver-plated snuff box sculpted like a miniature coffin."
9,"A beautiful framed portrait depicting the canvas of an ancient Elven forest as seen from the forest floor. The painting has an ethereal, magical look to it, with the sunlight filtering through the leaves actually emitting a glow."
10,"A branding rod made of an unknown oily metal that causes a feeling of revulsion when held. The head is shaped like the unholy symbol of the divine concept of ^EvilDomains^ and its metal is tinted the color of ash."
11,"A bronze armband in the shape of a snake spiraling from wrist to elbow."
12,"A bronze staff topped with a set of orbiting circles with a small, sun-like projection on the inside. The pieces slowly twist and turn."
13,"A burnished copper anklet with six bells and six amber charms shaped like songbirds."
14,"A back travois consisting of a sturdy leather harness and a set of jointed wooden poles with adjustable straps and buckles allowing the harness to fit humanoids, ponies and mules horses. The harness and poles connect together to form a simple triangle of wood and leather that can support up to 200 pounds and a creature can drag that weight far more easily than carrying it. The open end of the triangle rests across the bearer's shoulders, while the tip of the triangle drags on the ground behind. This device enables adventurers to more easily carry their fallen comrades out of hazardous areas so they can receive treatment in a more hospitable location or to carry back heavy plunder. In most cases, the head of the fallen is positioned near the head of the bearer to avoid exacerbating any injuries. When wearing a back travois, the bearer's carrying capacity is doubled but his base movement rate is reduced by half. A bearer can only transport individuals no more than twice his size with a back travois."
15,"A charcoal staff that has strange Ignan runes on it. It's warm to the touch and leaves soot on the bearer's hand. It can be used as a spellcasting focus for arcane magic."
16,"A creamy eggshell-colored stone carved in the shape of a small skull, marked by narrow, green-black threads. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as moss agate."
17,"A deep blue, high collared formal shirt. Embroidered nautical imagery in silver thread decorates the collar and cuffs."
18,"A deep red bead with bands of darker red. Inscribed on the bead are various esoteric symbols. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gemstone as banded jasper."
19,"A delicate gold ankle chain hung with six orange garnets and six red spinels."
20,"A detailed and colorful enamel brooch, which takes the shape of a tortoiseshell housecat curled up on a luxuriant red pillow with a lotus flower resting on its back, comes in a pale green jewelry case lined with light green felt."
21,"A dried bamboo tube containing an official-looking scroll, designed to authorize an adoption. The names and titles of the adoptive parent(s), child(ren) and dates are blank and could be filled in by anyone with decent handwriting."
22,"A fabulously well-made, shimmering blue-and-gold crushed velvet cape with white trim."
23,"A folding stool of ebony, its feet in the shape of wolves' paws and the seat fashioned from black wolfskin."
24,"A leather wallet stamped with the image of a chisel, saw and plane arranged in a triangle surrounding a tree. It contains a full set of certified identification papers denoting that the bearer is a member of the carpenters and woodworkers guild. The section containing the member's physical description (Height, weight, sex, race, eye, skin and hair color) is completely blank and could be filled in by anyone with half decent handwriting."
25,"A aged clay tablet etched with unfamiliar writing."
26,"A gold hair comb inset with tiny circles of translucent pale pink and white star rose quartz."
27,"A gold-handled fan made from the feathers of a desert roc."
28,"A headband made of embroidered silk and adorned with jade. A large, square-cut scintillating sapphire is set in the center of the headband. Celestial stitching on the inside of the headband reads, “Taketh thou, O holy believer, the cause of righteousness and be rewarded with health.” Knowledgeable PC's know that the embroidery around the headband details religious scenes from the holy book of a celestial deity who focuses on healing."
29,"A holy symbol of the concept of law consisting of dozens of tiny rings made from different types of precious metal. The rings link together intricately to form a downward pointing triangle."
30,"An ink quill that appears to have been fashioned from the feather of a sphinx and is fairly oversized for extended writing purposes."
31,"A jet brooch in shape of a black panther, its eyes are two diamonds."
32,"A jet-black hat made from shadow mastiff fur, with a silver wolf hat pin."
33,"An item known in roguish circles as a lock glass, that's a combination of a simple magnifying lens with an alchemical mixture that generates light. The magnifying glass is fitted with a long, narrow extension ringed with a substance similar to that used in sunrods. The bearer simply rubs the narrow tip of the lock glass to cause it to spring to light. It can then be inserted into a lock or other mechanical apparatus, allowing the bearer to peek through the lens and inspect the lock's inner workings. If the bearer spends one minute inspecting a lock with this device, he gains advantage on any check made involving that particular lock (Such as searching for and disarming traps or picking it open). The illumination portion of the lock glass can be used ten times before it must be replaced. Each use lasts one minute and the luminescent alchemical mixture can be reproduced by anyone proficient in alchemist's tools for about five gold pieces worth of materials."
34,"A large scroll that when unrolled, is revealed to contain a large painting displaying six devils."
35,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of a bountiful orchard whose trees are overflowing with fruit, the ripest of which has fallen and filled a cornucopia. The container is brimming with dozens of well preserved dried mulberries."
36,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of a well-stocked confectionary shop bustling with children. The container is filled with dozens of green, apple flavored hard candies."

41,"A large white china vase painted with blue foo lions, foo dogs and serpentine dragons."
42,"A leather belt pouch containing ##3d4## brownish-red ovular stones. They are nearly opaque, but the cut is not perfect; many are slightly chipped. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the stones as garnets."
43,"A metal singing bowl used to help serve as a focus for meditation. When the interior of the bowl is rubbed with a stick, it produces a haunting, hypnotic pair of wavering tones."
44,"A miniature gallows, complete with trapdoor and a weighted “hanged man”"
45,"A miniature, waterproof ebony chest lined with white satin. A galleon in full sail is inlaid in the lid in pale birch wood."
46,"A one gallon cask of Evermead, a pale golden liquor that is a favorite of elves, who value it for both its sweet flavorful bouquet as well as its many subtle undertones. Individuals who drink even one glass of Evermead are suffused for a short while with youthful vigor, freed from the infirmities of old age. Brewed from honey collected during the early spring from bees allowed access only to certain types of flowers, then combined with a number of wild spices, the brew is left to ferment in the living trees shaped through use of the wood shaping magic. After no less than a decade of fermentation the tree is tapped and the resulting evermead is strained, bottled, and prepared for consumption."
47,"A pair of ivory dice with gold pips in a velvet purse."
48,"A pair of translucent, sage-green gemstones. Their cut suggests they were once set into a ring. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the minerals as deep green spinels."

53,"A red, white and black wool rug with diamond patterns."
54,"A riding crop of good quality with a monogram on the handle and bit of agate in the pommel. It could fetch as much as a dozen gold pieces or even more if one can find a nobleman with the same initials."
55,"A rolled up leather case containing a half dozen knives meant for cleaning and preparing a kill for meals, rather than fighting in the wilderness. Replete with boning, skinning and other delicate knives, these blades are well crafted and provide a significant benefit for game hunters, whatever their prey. The set of hunting knives includes six different blades for a variety of dressing purposes."
56,"A rounded, triangular, translucent stone with green flecks that contrast sharply with the deep azure blue. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the gem as azurite."
57,"A rug of pure white girallon fur."
58,"A sack filled with ginger roots weighing five pounds."
59,"A seemingly innocuous scepter is made of a curious blue metal. One end of it is capped by a hollow circlet while two curved horns project from the other end. Overall, the scepter has the size and heft of a footman's mace."
60,"A set of clerical vestments of purest white velvet, with red silken sash and stole of cloth-of-gold."
61,"A set of pan-pipes made from the wing bones of a giant eagle."
62,"A soapstone smoking pipe with a thick wooden stem. The tool-pipe conceals its true purpose; its stem contains a tiny but complete set of thieves' tools. The size of the tools does limit their effectiveness somewhat, imposing a -1 penalty to any check made to use them. When the pipe is closed it is practically impossible to notice that it contains anything out of the ordinary."
63,"A set of three red onyx paperweights shaped like elephants."
64,"A set of weather beaten clothes that were stolen from a scarecrow."

67,"Eldritch Effigy: A ghastly figure made up of a series of articulated pieces of fire-blackened wood. A squat cylinder for the torso, a dented sphere for the head and limbs made up of a several smaller shapes, all bound together with black twine and heavy iron staples. It gives the unsettling impression of watching and hearing everyone and everything around it. The head and limbs moving occasionally as if to observe. Should a person spend a night alone and awake in a locked room with it, it slowly develops features reminiscent of their own."
68,"A small walnut chest, inlaid with a mosaic of a man drinking a toast and a woman playing the harp."
69,"A small wooden case contains a series of crystal fragments. They are uncut and filled with impurities, but each is a different color and carved with a different rune"
70,"A smooth, dark-green jade bracelet, sized for a child or a halfling."
71,"A specialty musical instrument, known as a whistle-pipe that is a favorite of some halfling bards because of the visual effects a musician skilled in its use can create. The whistle-pipe is a functional smoking pipe, artistically carved and incorporate tiny holes down the long stem. When used, the whistle-pipe emits tiny streamers of smoke through its holes and in the hands of a proficient musician streamers can even be shaped through breath and musical vibrations to accompany the tune being played on the pipe."

76,"A ten-pound copper ingot, shaped like an ox-hide, with a protruding handle in each of its four corners."
77,"A thick glass pot sealed tightly with wax. It is filled with an expensive black dye known as inscribing paint which is often used by mages when they need to create an impressive looking, inscribed symbol very quickly. This paint does the job, containing both metallic and black elements in a special mixture. When used to scribe fine lines this paint makes it look as though the lines are actually inlaid into the substance, not just painted on the surface. This is particularly useful for creating magical circles and runes. A pot contains enough paint to inscribe a ten-foot radius area. The ink takes only seconds to dry and is impossibly to wash off with nonmagical means, short of sanding of filing the material down a few millimeters."
78,"A thin, leather mask, designed to slip over the eyes and upper head of a falcon, simulates night, encourages rest, and calms a bird by limiting sensory stimuli. A hooded bird is unable to see and is more docile, generally making it unwilling to move or attack."

83,"A waterproof leather wallet containing 2d4+2 thick paper banknotes covered in precise writing, official seals and stamps of authentication. The notes have been issued by a few of the kingdom's major banking guilds and carry the value of ten gold pieces each. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that in large cities these forms of currency are popular as the banks regulate them, prices are higher and large sacks of metal coins are heavy to carry and are easy to spot by pickpockets. Smaller towns, hamlets and villages however still rely on the gold standard and are unlikely to accept paper as payment."
84,"A watertight bamboo box containing two dozen packets formed of folded and twine tied waxed paper containing a finely grated green root. Preserved well by its careful packaging, a whiff of it stimulates the sinuses and nostrils with a burn like strong mustard."
85,"A waxed leather case containing a bolt of fine, multicolored fabric spun by an esoteric magical technique from the feathers of peacocks."
86,"A bronze prayer wheel, taken from a remote monastery high in the Roof of the World Mountains."

89,"A worn leather eyepatch bearing the faded remnants of an eye embossed on it in gold leaf."
90,"A worn leather pouch that holds ##3d4## uncut green stones shot through with darker streaks. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the minerals as malachite."

93,"An ebony statuette of a tall, thin plains warrior carrying a spear."
94,"An evil relic of inky black stone, roughly the size of a man's clenched fist. When touched, the rock pulsates faintly, like the beating of a heart, and leaves the sensation of warm greasy moistness on the fingertips. The object exudes a palpable aura of evil, noticeable to intelligent creatures."
95,"An ingenious device known as a darkvision lantern, the secrets of its construction guarded by the craftsmen of all dwarven strongholds. The darkvision lantern takes the form of a standard hooded lantern, but the flame is surrounded by several crystals that filter out virtually all wavelengths of visible light. However, to those with darkvision, the lantern casts a strong glare, allowing them to see even further in pitch-blackness. A creature with darkvision using this lantern may double the range of Darkvision. The lantern burns typical oil at a rate of 1 pint per hour."
96,"An iron brazier for coals supported by the figures of three intricately carved nymphs."
97,"An ivory coffer, some six inches long by four wide, in the form of a coiled and sleeping wyvern. Its interior is lined with red silk but the contents are missing."

Mournful nobles throw themselves at the feet of the general, angels whisper words of counsel in the general's ear, and a pair of demons are working to drag the defeated ruler to the Nine Hells. Print numbered 143/200, signed by the artist. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that this is a while this is a historical depiction of a battle that did actually occurred, the general (Who was never confirmed to consort with demons despite his nearly supernatural good tactics) who won this battle lost his subsequent engagement (Immolated by fireball) and never got anywhere near the ruler whose army he defeated."
