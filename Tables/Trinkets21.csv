100,"Magebane Mine, Inert: A ordinary looking red brick that knowledgeable PC's recognize as an ancient mage slaying mine. The theory was that it was able to detect the innate magical presence within an individual and detonate. It was an complex experimental weapon back in its day and doesn't seem to work properly at the moment.  The device has magical as well as mechanical components and they would be dotted randomly throughout entire towns in walls, roads and residential buildings effectively “protecting” whole areas from mages and spellcasting creatures. The mechanical components would explode if their enchantments were dispelled and their magical payload would detonate if their physical components were disabled, making them all but impossible to neutralize. In fact the most common way to disable one (Assuming it could be distinguished, as it blended in like a brick in a brick wall) was to purposely trigger it from afar which tended to cause massive property damage. A spellcaster was required for most of the mine's construction which would explain why they were not mass produced. No mage of the time wanted to be responsible for massacring their own kind. This specific mine seems to be defective as it's physical components are in disrepair and the enchantments have faded, but a skilled enough mage, engineer or artificer might be able to repair it."
