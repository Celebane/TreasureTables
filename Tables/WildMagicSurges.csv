1,"The surging of mystical energies attracts the attentions of the God of War. The deity is in a gracious mood and grants a boon to a random creature within 60 feet of the caster who is armed with an instrument of battle. One non-magical weapon that the creature is wielding (Or just carrying if they aren't actively wielding it) is instantly transformed into a finely crafted version of itself gaining a Random Masterwork Bonus (See Note). The grip of the weapon becomes emblazoned with the holy symbol of the God of War and the weapon may gain a different physical appearance or construction to better match the description of the Masterwork Bonus. The change to the weapon is permanent. ---Note: The Masterwork Bonus is: ^MasterworkWeaponBonuses^"
2,"A brief empathic link is formed through the spell's magic and the caster and the target both experience an intense sense of kinship and find themselves physically, mentally and emotionally unable to harm each other in any way for 1d4 rounds."
3,"The wild magics impregnate the very air with life as the spell's mystical energies gives birth to a miniature tornado. The newborn whirlwind considers the caster its parent and attacks the last creature to have harmed the caster. Sadly, the elemental's form is unstable and it dies after one minute if not slain first. —Note: The elemental acts on the turn immediately after the caster and the DM can use wolf statistics for the elemental's equivalent statistics for hit points, attacks, size, etc if no better option is available. At higher levels of play, the statistics of a larger elemental or dire wolf can be used to keep this surge relevant."
4,"The beginning of the spell creates a sonic feedback loop that magnifies all noises that the casters makes, including any sounds from his equipment or anything he touches. For the next ten minutes the caster is ten times louder than he normally is and he suffers from disadvantage on stealth and move silently checks."
5,"A drifting seed of abjuration magic is attracted to the spellcasting and feeds on the excess energy created by the powerful surge. The protective mote quickly grows into a large shield of spectral force that hovers around the caster warding off incoming attacks. The caster's defenses are increased as if he were properly wielding a shield and for one hour the magical armor guards the caster's person before the shield fades away."
6,"The caster's spell bends and focuses the light around him, firing it in a precise ray of white hot light directly at the target who becomes blinded until the end of their next turn."
7,"The caster taps into the primal, natural magic's of creation and spontaneously generates 5d20 black rats, which burst forth from his clothing and packs. The rats have no special kinship with their creator and will attempt to flee the caster and seek food and shelter as typical rats would. Although the caster takes no damage directly, the sheer amount of unkempt wild animals on his person causes him to suffer disadvantage on rolls made to resist diseases or sickness until he is able to spend at least ten minutes bathing."
8,"The caster's body is momentarily inhabited by the spirit of a Dwarven hero of legend. The spirit imparts a measure of dwarven fortitude to the caster who becomes immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 5d6 days."
9,"The caster's rare, wild magic attracts the ever-curious attentions of the God of Knowledge. The deity observes the spellcasting for a moment categorizing and understanding every movement and action on a level that no mere mortal could ever understand should they devote their entire lives to studying the scene. After a heartbeat the God is satisfied with the information gained and graces the caster with a gift from his infinite library. Knowledge is true power and a Random Book bearing the God's holy symbol cleanly stamped into its spine is teleported into the caster's belongings. ---Note: The Random Book is: ^AllRandomBooks^"
10,"A cloud of eldritch mist wafts down from the caster's hands as he performs the motions of the spell and settles into a dense fog around his feet. The energy coalesces into a solid object, trapping the caster's legs and reducing his movement speed to zero until the end of his next turn."
11,"The caster briefly accesses the genetic memory of his bloodline and suddenly witnesses a memory from one of his ancestors. The ancient relative imparts a measure of wisdom and inspiration to the caster that stays with him and grants him courage and determination in the face of adversity. Until the caster next has a full night's rest, he is able to make use of his forebearer's insight and grant himself advantage on any one attack roll, saving throw or ability check."
12,"A chorus of ethereal voices congratulate the caster on performing the spell and compliment the quality of the verbal intonations, somatic movements and the caster's general appearance. For the next hour, anytime the caster performs any successful action (Such as casting a spell, landing an attack, or carrying out a feat of skill), he is met with the murmured approval and commentary of the voices."
13,"A cluster of neurons in the caster's brain misfire, causing him to momentarily forget about whatever he was actively in the middle of doing. Although the mental hiccup is not enough to disrupt the spellcasting, the magical surge replicates and propagates the lapse of neural function over a wide area, turning a split section hesitation into several seconds of group aphasia. Until the start of the caster's next turn, all creatures within 50 feet temporarily forget all of their combat training and are no longer considered proficient in any type of physical weapon. Creatures may still attack with weapons they aren't proficient with but they take the usually penalties associated with doing so. Creatures still remember any unarmed fighting experience they've had and can shove, bull rush, trip, punch or make attacks with natural weapons like claws or fangs as they normally would."
14,"A fraction of conjuration magic is summoned into the caster's spell, causing the caster and the target to immediately switch places by means of magical teleportation."
15,"A measure of transmutation magic is imbued into the spell, altering the target's physical form upon contact. When damaged by the spell, instead of producing blood, ichor or other similar substance, the target bleeds pure gold droplets. The equivalent of one gold coin per point of hit point damage dealt by the spell, tumbles out of the target's body and falls to the ground."
16,"A miasma of bad luck envelops the target and taints their future. The target's next significant action is automatically considered a natural 1 or critical fumble, regardless of their actual roll."
17,"A miasma of necromantic energy coalesces around the nearest corpse within 100 feet. The body rises from the dead as a zombie or skeleton and immediately attacks the nearest living creature to itself. The undead will continue to be hostile to the closest living being (Whoever that happens to be at the start of its turn) until it is destroyed or after one minute passes at which time the magic animating it fails and it crumbles in a heap. —Note: The zombie acts on the turn immediately after the caster and the DM can use wolf statistics for the undead's equivalent statistics for hit points, attacks, size, etc if no better option is available. At higher levels of play, dire wolf statistics can be used to keep this surge relevant."
18,"A freak spark of conjuration magic summons an unattended bauble from somewhere in the world. The curio is teleported from its resting place and appears unharmed at the caster's feet. Roll a Random Trinket to select the conjured item."
19,"A minuscule fraction of the caster's willpower splinters off becoming an independent being of pure magical force. The creature is an invisible, mindless and shapeless mass that can perform simple tasks at the caster's mental command and functions as a loyal servant. The being can exert up to 30 pounds of force and can perform simple tasks (But cannot attack) that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once given a command, the creature performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for its next command. The unseen servant remains in existence for up to eight hours, until it moves more than 60 feet away from the caster or until it takes any damage, at which point the being dissipates and the splinter of willpower is reabsorbed into the caster's psyche."
20,"A seed of rejuvenating magic escapes the upper planes of the heavens and deposits itself in the caster's body. Should the caster die within the next minute, they are immediately brought back to life at 1 hit point and suffer no ill effects from dying."
21,"A single drop from the river of time lands on the target, altering his personal stream of fate. The target instantly disappears and reappears in the same place exactly one minute later. The target is not automatically aware that he has been propelled into the future and as far as he is concerned no time passed from his perspective."
22,"A small black thundercloud forms a foot above the casters head and begins raining down, quickly soaking him. The bright lights of small lightning bolts of static electricity shock and annoy the caster while the rumblings of miniaturized thunder can be heard even in the distance. For the next minute the caster suffers disadvantage on all checks made to hide or be stealthy in any way and on checks made to concentrate on ongoing spells or abilities that require the caster's focus."
23,"A surge of oddly specific, size augmenting magic ripples across the target's skin affecting only insects. Each and every creeping crawling creature on the target's body is greatly increased in size (To the approximate size of a large coin) and every previously ignorable dust mite, flea, ant, tick or louse becomes extremely apparent. Roll 5d20 and that many vermin creep across the target's flesh and clothes prickling his skin and horrifying onlookers. For the next minute the target has disadvantage on any checks involving fine motor skills or concentration as the pins and needles sensation of the insect legs is a distraction. He also suffers disadvantage on any charisma based checks as no person readily negotiates with, believes or is afraid of someone with coin sized fleas crawling all over him."
24,"A thunderous shockwave tears up the ground in a ten foot radius around the caster. The ground is left irregular, precarious and treacherous becoming difficult terrain. Creatures move at half speed in and out of this area and moving five feet in or out of the difficult terrain costs ten feet of speed."
25,"A vampiric, life-leeching hunger is awoken within the caster and he is able to utilize the surging magic to sate the unnatural thirst. The caster must choose a living creature within 15 feet and siphons off a measure of their life essence which deals one hit point of damage per the victim's character level (Or 10% of their maximum health or other equivalent amount) to the victim while healing the caster for the same amount. If there is no living creature within 15 feet, the caster takes one hit point damage per character level (Or 10% of his maximum health or other equivalent amount) as their body consumes itself for sustenance."
26,"A wave of ancient druidic magic flows outwards from the caster and into the ground. Luscious healthy grasses, clovers and wildflowers sprout up one foot high in a matter of seconds in a 50 foot radius around the caster. The plants are healthy and root if possible in whatever soil is available but afterwards they will live or die based on the local environment."
27,"A wave of purifying cleansing magic washes over the caster and he is cured of one (Caster's choice) ongoing poison, disease, curse or other negative condition or effect. If there is no such valid targets the caster is healed one hit point damage per character level (Or 10% of maximum health or other equivalent amount) as the surge mends torn flesh."
28,"Aberrant sorcery floods the caster's body, spawning an unnatural mutation. The caster feels a momentary flare of agonizing pain somewhere on his person and a ten foot long tentacle bursts forth from the site, bypassing armor and clothing. The sinuous tentacle is heavily muscled like a long dry tongue covered in irregular blemishes, unnatural mottled coloring, small patches of hair and misshapen areas of perfectly smooth or heavily calloused skin. The abnormal limb is prehensile and can stretch out to ten feet allowing the caster to grab and hold (But not wield) objects, initiate grapples, shoves or other combat maneuvers and deliver touch attacks or spells that have a range of touch, all with the increased reach. The limb can even be swung with force as an unarmed attack the caster is considered proficient with that deals as much damage as a club with a reach of ten feet. The tentacle last for one hour before retracting back into the caster's body."
29,"After completing the spell, the last particles of magical power stay on the caster's skin rather than dissipate into the air. The trace remnants multiply and spread until the caster's body is sheathed in a thin layer of protective energy. For the next minute, the first time the caster would take any single source of damage, the protection negates it entirely leaving the caster unharmed after which the energy fades."
30,"All of the gold coins on the caster's person are transformed into pearls. The value of each pearl is roughly twice as much as a typical gold coin but very few merchants are willing to trade in dozens of pearls rather than sacks of gold. The caster may have to seek out a jeweler, exotic goods merchant or rich noble who would be able to comfortably appraise the value of the pearls and agree to trade for them."
31,"An arid gust of stale, dry air bursts from the caster's mouth. All liquids within 30 feet turn to salt, ash, dust or slime (Roll a d4 or DM's discretion) and no longer provide refreshment. A large body of liquid such as a pool or lake is only affected up to a depth of two feet. The caster is unharmed but left with a terribly parched mouth and throat."
32,"As he completes the spell the caster takes a deep breath as the rush of magical energy flows through his body. Unfortunately the caster inhales too deeply and a stray mote of magic enters his nose causing immense pain. A torrent of caustic slime spews out of the caster's nose and he takes acid damage equivalent to a dagger and is unable to smell at all for one week."
33,"The caster's spell becomes tainted with foul creation magic, creating voracious insects where there was once healthy flesh. For each 1 point of hit point damage the spell deals to the target, two hungry locust are spontaneously generated in the resulting wound and chew themselves out of the target's skin dealing additional damage equivalent to a dagger. The hungry vermin form an angry swarm around their host and attack with a ravenous ferocity. At the end of the target's next turn he takes an additional damage equal to a dagger as the locusts single minded hunger spur them to devour the target's flesh. After dealing the secondary damage, the cloud of insects lose their drive and disperse into various directions. —Note: At higher levels the swarm damage can be upgraded from that of a dagger to being equal to a shortsword, longsword or greatsword to keep this surge relevant."
34,"As the caster entwines together the threads of magic to weave the spell, he is also able to bend and knit the very light around him causing him to pass from sight. After the spell is completed, the caster becomes invisible and remains that way for the next minute or until he makes an attack or casts a spell."
35,"As the caster intones the spell, a small tongue of flame forms above his head and burns without consuming fuel or producing heat. The fire's light illuminates the caster's mind as well as their face and grants them the divine gift of Allspeak or Tongues. For the next hour the caster is able to understand any spoken language he hears. Moreover, when the caster speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target, perfectly understands what he says."
36,"As the caster performs the physical gestures of the spell his eyes are attracted to the precise, hypnotic motions of his hands and can focus on nothing else. Once the spell is completed, the caster looks up in a confused daze, unaware of his surroundings and has completely forgets the events of the last 1d10 hours."
37,"As the caster's magic flares, the world around him slows to a crawl moving in slow motion to his supernaturally accelerated perspective and reflexes. The hasted caster may immediately take one additional action that is the equivalent to using an object, casting a spell or making an attack."
38,"As the spell is completed, should the target be negatively affected, the caster experiences a momentary flashback of the most violent act he has ever committed. During the caster's next eight hours (Consecutive or non-consecutive) of sleep he suffers from severe night terrors. The caster's relives every violent, cruel and sadistic act he has ever inflicted on another being and his sleep is plagued with thrashing and screaming as he frequently bolts awake terrified, drenched in cold sweat, his heart pounding heavily in his chest. The caster's sleep is so disturbed by the nightmares that he gain no benefits from the rest whatsoever."
39,"As the surge begins, excess magical energy shed by the spell as waste is collected and forms a feedback loop that absorbs more of the normally-unused power in order to greatly enhance the end result. Immediately roll again for another surge and all the resulting surge effects are twice as strong as normal. For example it lasts twice as long, the range is twice as wide, twice as many things happens, the target is effected twice, etc."
40,"Colorful bubbles come out of caster's mouth instead of words for the next minute. Words are released when bubbles pop which takes several seconds. Any noises made by the caster are heard on the round after the caster speaks them. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast properly during this time."
41,"Multiple disciplines of magic are careless welded together into a crude version of a proper spell. Elements of time and mental magics blend around the spell the caster was actually performing and fling the surge-created proto-spell into the past. The memory of the caster is erased from the minds and thoughts of every creature that has known him for less than a period of seven days. The caster is neither recognized nor remembered by those creatures and returns to complete anonymity. Affected creatures will automatically rationalize holes in their memory with any plausible ideas and are not aware they have been affected. The spell has no effect on creature that first met the caster more than seven days before, nor does the magic have an effect on written work such as journals or arrest warrants."
42,"Rather than being outwardly focused the wild magic alters the caster's own body and his hair grows a foot in length and turns a florescent ^BrightColourTable^. This change is permanent until new hair grows in."
43,"Ten wicked looking knives of glowing magical energy form out of thin air and hover over the caster's fingers on both hands. Each round, caster can point at up to two creatures he can see within 50 feet and will the spectral blades to bury themselves in those targets. This action is swift, similar to drawing an arrow from a quiver and the caster can be holding or wielding objects while doing this. The knives unerringly seek out their victims and never miss, dealing force damage equivalent to a dagger. The knives disappear after one minute or after striking a target."
44,"The arcane surge concentrates itself on a random non-magical weapon on the caster's person. The object becomes filled with transmogrifying energy and the weapon is completely and permanently transformed into a different and wholly unique item. The new weapon is: (^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^"
45,"The caster accidentally tears open a dimensional rift and is teleported 25 feet in a random direction (Roll a d4 for North, East, South or West) and appears in an unoccupied area. A small trail of fire appears from their starting position to their teleported position and quickly burns itself out."
46,"The spell's force and potential energy builds in intensity over its casting and at the climax it misfires, creating an arcane blast of force. The spell is cast successfully but the magical explosion hits the caster unawares, pushing him 15 feet in the opposite direction of the target (Or roll a d6 for a random direction if there's no target) and knocking him prone but leaving him otherwise unharmed."
47,"The caster and those around him are masked in illusionary magic and every creature within 30 feet of the caster becomes invisible for the next minute. The invisibility ends on an individual creature when it attacks or casts a spell."
48,"The caster and those around him are swept up in an eldritch maelstrom that teleports them around the area. Although the caster is also engulfed in the wild tempest he is able to direct it and he must choose 2d4+1 creatures (Including himself) within 60 feet of himself and switch their positions with each other so that each creature ends a space other than where they started."
49,"The caster becomes a conduit for the chaotic realm of magic and their body is enveloped with magical distortions similar to heat mirages. For the next minute, the caster's body becomes blurred, shifting wavering to all who can see him. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against the caster. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight. The caster's vision is not impaired as the chaotic magic flowing through him provides him the power to see through the effect."
50,"The caster becomes cursed with a trifling cantrip often used as a prank among novice wizards. For the next hour, the caster appears as a sheep to all other creatures. When the caster speaks, others hear only bleating. This is an illusionary effect and causes no physical change and does not prevent the caster from moving or speaking. The caster is not automatically aware of this effect and part of the prank is how long it may take him to understand his situation."
51,"The caster briefly gains a measure of direction over the turbulent magic raging through his body and can choose to attempt to solidify part of that power as part of his being. Successfully doing so will grant permanent improvement but a failed attempt will degrade very aspect of the caster that he was trying to improve. The caster may choose one of his ability scores (Such as Strength or Wisdom) and flip a coin. If heads, the caster increases that ability score by +1 (To a maximum of the limit for PC ability scores) but if tails, that ability score is decreased by -1. This change is a permanent effect, although the caster may choose the same ability score if he gets this result again. Should the caster be at peace with who he is, he may choose not to alter a score."
52,"The caster channels fey magic and turns into a potted plant (Which is the fey equivalent of human slapstick humor and doesn't translate well) until the start of his next turn. While a plant, the caster can take no actions, have no awareness of his surroundings and takes twice as much damage whenever he is injured. If the caster drops to 0 hit points, the pot breaks and the caster's form reverts to normal."
53,"The caster experiences a nervous, fluttery feeling in his stomach as if he was incredibly nervous. The sensation quickly builds in intensity and after only a few seconds it seems to erupt out of him and a stream of live butterflies pour from the caster's mouth. This lasts one minute and does not hamper his ability to speak or breath, although he may accidentally squash some of the insects if he moves his mouth too quickly."
54,"The caster flashes with a halo of golden light that hangs in the air around him and moves with him. For the next minute, all creatures caught in this light (15 foot radius) are healed for twice as much as they normally would and are incapable of speaking a lie."
55,"The spell harnesses the volatile energies of the realm of chaos to fuel its lethal potential. However these energies are by nature unpredictable and the magic is weakened just as often as it is strengthened. The player must flip a coin. If heads, the damage is rolled normally and then increased by a factor or 50%. If tails, the damage is rolled normally then halved."
56,"The caster is affected by a small burst of unregulated chronomancy. The player must roll a d10. The caster's age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, he gets ages. If the roll is even, he gets younger (To a minimum of one year old)."
57,"The caster's eyes flash with a strange color and for the next hour he perceives the skin and muscles of all others creatures as fully transparent, revealing their bones, organs and viscera."
58,"The caster is overwhelmed by the everpresent flow of druidic magic and is transformed into the shape of a wolf. This change lasts for one minute, until the caster falls unconscious, drops to zero hit points or dies. While in the shape of the wild animal, the caster's statistics are replaced by that of a wolf but he retains his personality and mental faculties. Upon transformation the caster assumes a typical wolf's hit points and when those are gone he reverts back to his typical form with the same number of hit points he had before transforming. The caster cannot speak, cast spells that require speech or physical movements or take actions that require the use of hands. The caster's equipment merges into his new form and becomes indestructible and unusable until he changes back at which time everything is returned to normal. —Note: In higher level play the DM should feel free to change the form from that of a wolf to a stronger wild creature (Such as a dire wolf, gorilla or bear) to keep this surge relevant."
59,"The caster is surrounded by disturbing illusions, causing him to appear in the form of a bizarre and unspeakably terrifying creature. The caster must immediately make an intimidate check against all creatures within 15 feet of himself. The illusions fade at the start of the caster's next turn."
60,"The caster is surrounded in a corona of kinetic energy that waits for an incoming force. For the next minute, the first time the caster is struck by a melee attack, the corona's potential energy reacts, repelling the blow in the direction it came from. The caster only takes half of the rolled damage from the attack as the enemy's weapon rebounds back into the attacker's body dealing the other half of the damage to that creature."
61,"The caster is surrounded with a pleasant and calming enchantment. A flock of illusory butterflies and gusts of flower petals flutter in the air within ten feet of himself for the next minute."
62,"The caster is swept up by the flow of the magical power and feels as though they could simply step through space as they might step through a doorway. At the end of the spell the caster is able to instantly teleport to any unoccupied space that they are aware of within 50 feet."
63,"The caster is temporarily blessed with a natural gift for divination and second sight. For the next minute, the caster can see invisible creatures as if they were visible and can see the true form of shapechangers and creatures disguised with illusionary or transmutation magic as long as they are within 30 feet of him."
64,"The caster is wracked in pain and his body is physically transformed into a ^Humanoid^. The change is superficial and does not have any effect on his statistics or abilities. The polymorph effect wears off after 1d4 months and is considered a curse effect that can removed using cursebreaking spells or abilities."
65,"The caster mispronounces the spell slightly causing the intonation to be slightly off. The spell still functions normally but leaves the language center of the caster's mind scrambled. For the next hour the caster suffers from aphasia and is not able to understand any spoken or written language nor are they able to speak or write in any meaningful way. The caster hears words and sees letters as gibberish and speaks in nonsensical noises that only convey tone of voice at best. During this time, the caster can still cast spells with verbal requirements as he does remember the correct words, (Forming them in his mind and believes that he is saying them) they simply come out irreparably mangled."
66,"The caster sprouts large membranous wings from their back, elbows, neck or ears (DM's discretion). The caster gains the ability to fly proficiently at their normal land movement. The wings wither and slough off after one hour."
67,"The caster's actions have drawn the attention of the God of ^RandomGodlyDomains^ who exacts a tithe as compensation for their blessing. The God immediately teleports away 10% of the caster's total wealth (Measured in metal and paper currency carried on the caster's person) and rewards the generous “donation” with a spark of divine essence that remains in the caster's body. While carrying the blessing, when the caster fails to succeed at a roll (Such as but not limited to: an attack, saving throw or ability check) he may choose to activate the holy spark, causing it to flare within him and the roll is treated as a critical success or a natural 20. The spark burns itself out after seven days if not used within that time. The caster feels a strong sense of religious devotion while the spark remains inside them and feels motivated to carry out the basic tenets of the domain the God represents. The caster is not compelled to act in this way and is not forced to violate any strongly held morals or beliefs. If the caster has no metal or paper currency of any kind, the God instead takes a blood sacrifice which deals two hit points of damage per character level (Or 20% of maximum health or other equivalent amount) to the caster but otherwise functions the same."
68,"The caster's body acts as a conduit for tiny fraction of the holy power from the celestial plane of the God of Music. The area around the caster is filled with a heavenly sounds lasts for only a few moments but whose musical notes seem to linger on the air. The caster is divinely inspired and immediately becomes permanently proficient with the ^RandomMusicalInstruments^."
69,"The caster's ephemeral magic manipulates the physical world and a 10x10 foot square pillar with a height of ten feet rises up from underneath the target. The caster chooses the column's location but it must originate from underneath the target. The pillar is not simply the ground raised up and is actually another dimension extending into this one. Therefore the tower has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. The pillar can only be created on a horizontal surface of sufficient size but it can be created in the deck of a ship as easily as in a stone or forest floor or a sandy desert. Creatures who are in the area where the pillar is created are raised up ten feet. Should the lifted creatures make contact with a ceiling or overhead object, they are not instantly squashed but rather take damage as if they had fallen ten feet and the pillar stops rising. The sides of the column are made of coarse stone and are as difficult to climb as a sheer brick wall. After one minute the dimensional magic loses its potency and creatures and objects on top of the tower are lowered down until they are standing on ground level over the course of a single round."
70,"The caster's hair disappears, reappearing 1d6 days later, washed, braided and decorated with flowers."
71,"The caster's magic becomes tainted with traces of warped gravitation energy that causes the very matter of his targets to pull themselves apart. For the next hour, the next creature the caster kills with a spell harmlessly explodes covering a 15 foot radius in viscera, bone splinters, blood and gore. All of the target's nonmagical equipment is scattered, disgusting and heavily damaged from the blast."
72,"The caster's magic disrupts the natural weather cycle and causes the air above his head to form thick storm clouds in a matter of moments. Until the start of the caster's next turn the dark clouds precipitate (Normally rain, but sleet, hail or snow according to DM's discretion of the environment's weather) down in a concentrated area of a 60 foot radius centered on the caster. Seconds after they form and have dumped their moisture back onto the ground, the clouds disperse as if they were never there, leaving everything soaking wet."
73,"The caster's skin hardens, raises and splits into a multitude of armored scales that resembles the skin of a crocodile. The caster's newly grown hide is thick and rugged while remaining just as mobile and dexterous as his normal skin. The magically strengthened, leathery exterior provides the caster the same physical protection as if they were wearing a suit of chainmail without imposing any negatives other than the weird looks or comments on his appearance. This change lasts until the caster next has a full night's sleep and he wakes in a pile of shed scales and finds his skin returned to normal."
74,"The caster's skin is infused with energy and shines as bright as a torch in a Random Bright Colour (^BrightColourTable^) for the next minute."
75,"The caster's spell becomes a prime example of the physical law that states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. A wave of anti-magic that pulses out of tune with the spell's magic comes into focus and burst forth, dispelling enchantments on contact. One random enchantment, curse or ongoing spell (Positive or negative) that is affecting the target is immediately dispelled. A fraction of a moment later, the caster's actual spell hits the target which prevents the surge from canceling itself out."
76,"The caster's magic allows him a choice to alter the flow of time and create a stable temporal anomaly. The caster can choose to borrow time from himself and immediately gain the benefits of a full eight hours of rest along with all the benefits that entails, such as regaining hit points, spells and class abilities. However this debt to himself must be paid and they next time the caster takes a long rest, he instead drops into a coma-like state similar to sleep. The caster does not benefit in any way from the coma and does not regain hit points, regain spells or recharge class abilities. Furthermore the caster is treated as if he has not slept and after the coma he is exhausted as if he had not rested at all. The caster can simply choose to take another long rest but oftentimes questing adventures don't have the chance to wait on one of their members to sleep for an additional eight hours. The caster can choose not to borrow time from himself at which point the temporal magic fades away and the surge does nothing."
77,"The caster's magic lingers in his mind turning it into a resonating beacon that projects his thoughts and feelings freely to anyone close enough to receive them. For the next ten minutes, all intelligent creatures within 30 feet are automatically able to learn the surface thoughts of the caster and what is most on his mind in that moment. A creature who takes no other actions other than concentrating on the caster's thoughts is able to learn more of the caster's emotional state and gains insight into anything that is looming large in the caster's mind (Such as something he worries over, loves, or hates). All intelligent creatures within 30 feet of the caster have advantage on insight or sense motive checks against him. The caster is not automatically aware that he is projecting his mind in this fashion."
78,"The caster's magic lingers in the air around himself waiting to be charged with offensive magical power to better serve its creator. For the next hour, the next time the caster would be harmed by a magical damage type (Such as fire, psychic or force) he becomes wreathed in protective energy of the same kind which reduces the incoming damage dealt by half. For the remainder of the hour, the elemental shield provides the caster resistance to its type of magic and he takes half damage from that type only."
79,"The caster's magic opens a pair of dimensional rifts in the multiverse where two different parallel version of himself have just cast spells that resulted in wild surges. The surges of the doppelgangers are channeled through the rifts into the caster's universe and becomes his to command. Immediately roll for two more surges and both results happen."
80,"The caster's spell becomes tainted with malevolent creation magic creating disgusting vermin where there was once healthy flesh. For each 1 point of hit point damage the spell deals to the target, five blowflies are spontaneously generated in the resulting wound, bursting forth in a black cloud of filth. The flies cluster around the target forming an angry swarm, biting and flying at the target's exposed skin and sensitive face. The swarm is relentless in its attacks and the target becomes forced to bat and swing at them wildly and move out of the center of the angry cloud in order to keep the insects from entering his eyeballs, nose, ears and mouth. Whenever the target ends their turn they must immediately roll a d4 to determine what direction (1 North, 2 East, 3 South, 4 West) he is moved as a result of the flies. The target moves five feet in that direction (If the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move) and then loses any remaining movement speed for the turn. After one minute the swarm loses its magical ferocity, the flies dissipate to the surrounding area and the effect ends."
81,"The caster briefly gains a measure of total control over the being that he is and who he could be. The caster may switch any two of his ability scores with each other. For example switching Strength with Wisdom. This change is a permanent effect (Although the caster may reverse this effect if they get this result again or use other means of ability score switching) and the caster may choose not to switch any scores."
82,"The caster's magic manipulates the fabric of reality and a 10x10 foot square pit with a depth of ten feet, opens under the target. The caster chooses the pit's location but it must open underneath the target. The pit is not quite a hole and actually extends into another dimension and therefore the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying material. The pit can only be created on a horizontal surface of sufficient size but it can be created in the deck of a ship as easily as in a stone or forest floor or a sandy desert. Creatures who are in the area where the chasm is created tumble into it take falling damage as normal. The inside of the shaft has coarse stone walls are as difficult to climb as a sheer brick wall. After one minute the dimensional magic loses its potency and creatures and objects trapped in the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit until they are standing on ground level over the course of a single round."
83,"The caster's spell curses him with phobia inducing hallucinations and he instantly develops a severe and unnatural fear of whatever object or weapon that he is currently holding. The caster must immediately drop the item and cannot, pick up, use or directly interact with it under any circumstance. —Note: I recommend against having the caster fear his own spellcasting focus or spell component pouch and be effectively doing nothing for the next minute, especially in a combat situation."
84,"The caster's spell slows the flow of time in his location and to his perspective it seems like everyone else moving unnaturally quickly. For the next minute the caster is magically slowed and during his turns he is only able to take an action equivalent to casting a spell, using an item or making an attack, OR he may choose to move his standard speed, but not both in the same turn."
85,"The spell is infused with energy at the cost of accuracy, veering completely off course at the very last moment. Instead of the intended target, the spell targets a random creature within 60 feet of the caster. If the spell was an area of effect power, the new target becomes the center of the area of effect."
86,"A seed of necromantic energy is planted into the target and begins to take root. If the target is killed within the next minute, the corpse rises as a zombie that is loyal to the caster and follows his verbal commands. The undead is not intelligent and can only move, attack and perform simple tasks. Over time the caster's hold of the zombie becomes more strained as the magic begins to wane. Roll 1d10 at dawn every day and if the rolled result is lower than the number of days the zombie has been animate, the undead breaks free of the caster's control and attempts to kill all living creatures it can find. —Note: If the creature is not a valid target for raising as an undead or if the DM does not want the party to have access to that creature as a zombie (Such as a dragon, giant or mindflayer) the player should roll for a different surge. The zombie acts on the turn immediately after the caster and the DM can use wolf statistics for the undead's equivalent statistics for hit points, attacks, size, etc if no better option is available. At higher levels of play, dire wolf or stronger undead's statistics can be used to keep this surge relevant."
87,"The spell is infused with energy at the cost of accuracy and it veers off unexpectedly. Rather than the intended target, the spell affects a random target within 60 feet of the caster."
88,"The caster's spell vibrates oxygen molecules around him at a certain frequency, creating a hypersonic tone. Although too high pitched to affect the hearing range of living creatures, all non-magical glass or crystal objects within 50 feet of the caster shatter."
89,"The caster's unpredictable sorcery briefly attracts the attention of the chaotic God of Travel who grants a minor favor in the caster's journey by undoing barriers set in his path. All locking mechanisms within 100 feet of the caster become unlocked."
90,"The casting of the spell creates a minor summoning glyph and the air is filled with the sounds of squawking as 4d6 live and extremely agitated chickens appear at the caster's feet. They are perfectly ordinary chickens and will attempt to flee combat if threatened."
91,"The chaotic surges send ripples of energy through the caster's soul causing him to attract the vague attentions of his God. During the caster's next restful sleep, he will receive a vision from his deity. The vision takes the form of a dream, in which they will be imparted with wisdom, instruction or advice that his god requires him to know. The message can last for hours or be as brief as a single sentence depending on the deity's personality and the length of the instruction. The deity may be less than pleased to have been distracted by the wild surge and their instruction may simply be a warning to be more careful using magic and not to waste their time. The caster will wake normally, remember the dream perfectly and their sleep is otherwise unaffected."
92,"The caster channels the unpredictable energy of Fey magic and can mark a number of his enemies as intruders into the wild lands. The caster can choose up to 2d4 creatures that he can see with 60 feet of himself to be outlined in pale glowing flames that shine as brightly as a candle in a color the caster chooses.  Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, invisibility, camouflage, or mundane stealth but the light is too dim to have any special effect on creatures vulnerable to bright light. The illusionary faerie flames cause no damage or unpleasant sensation and fade away after one minute."
93,"The closest, non-magical shield within 100 feet (Other than any on other caster's person) of the caster is permanently turned into a flower basket. The basket is made from wicker and the potted wildflowers are in full bloom and smell delightful. Wicker baskets filled with dirt and colorful plants provide no protection or combat bonuses whatsoever."
94,"The completion of the spell starts resonance canceling feedback cycle that negates all sounds that the caster makes, including any noises from his equipment or anything he touches. For the next ten minutes the caster is completely silent and he gains advantage on stealth and move silently checks. This does not suppress the caster's ability to cast spell that require verbal components, the feedback cycle simply consumes the sonic vibrations the instant they are intoned."
95,"The eldritch interference caused by the surge either provides a boon to the caster or a further drain on his magical reserves. The player must flip a coin. If heads, the spell that was cast does not expend a spell per day, spell slot or mana. If tails the spell expends two spells per day, two spell slots or twice as much mana as normal."
96,"The eldritch power directed by the caster becomes physically dense, creating a well of gravitation energy. All creatures within a 50 foot radius of the caster are pulled five feet closer to him."
97,"The spell was abnormally power causing the excess energy to ricochet off of the target in a beautiful opalescent barrage of colors. The caster must direct this magic towards another creature within 15 feet of the first target. The barrage automatically hits and deals force damage equal to half of the damage dealt by the spell. —Note: The spell that triggered this surge is unchanged and is considered to be cast successfully and affects the original target normally."
98,"The magic twins itself and the caster experiences the same spell effect as the target would. The caster is granted the same type of save against the spell (Should he choose to resist it) and if the spell has an area of effect the caster is considered to have been caught inside of it but it does not create a secondary zone of magical effect."
99,"The power of the raging inferno that burns at the heart of the elemental plane of fire rests at the caster's fingertips. For the next minute, any flammable object the caster touches that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame."
100,"The primordial surging of raw magic coursing through the caster's body forces an evolutionary surge. The caster feels a strange tingling sensation under his shoulders and a secondary pair of arms burst out of his sides, bypassing armor and clothing. The extra arms lack the refined muscle memory of the caster's normal limbs and are considered non-dominate or off-hands which are capable of holding objects (But not wielding them) and performing very basic tasks but nothing that requires finesse or skill. The additional limbs are as well muscled their counterparts, allowing the caster to excel at tasks that simply require overwhelming strength or sheer brute force. The caster is able to give himself a couple of helping hands and gains advantage on all strength checks and any rolls made to grapple or wrestle. The arms last for one hour before retracting back into the caster's body."
101,"The rush of magic penetrates the target's mind and imparts some of that knowledge to the caster. The caster gains the ability to perfectly speak and understand any forms of written and oral communication that the target is fluent in. The caster is immediately aware that he has gained this ability and the effect ends after one hour, at which points the memories of the other languages fade away."
102,"The spell builds momentum as it races towards the targets increasing in velocity similarly to a snowball rolling downhill that grows in weight and power. The magical energy slams into the target, forcefully pushing the creature 15 feet backwards and knocking him prone but leaving him otherwise unharmed."
103,"The spell channels the unpredictable grace of the God of Luck to fuel its power. This energy is by nature chaotic and the magic is weakened just as often as it is strengthened. The player must flip a coin. If heads, all the targets of the spell make their spell save with disadvantage. If tails, all the targets of the spell make their spell save with advantage."
104,"The caster grows a long beard made of feathers that remains until he sneezes, at which point the feathers explode out from his face."
105,"The caster is affected by a small burst of chaotic transmutation magic. The player must roll a d10. The caster's height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, he shrinks. If the roll is even, he grows."
106,"The uncontrolled sorcery destroys the typical bell curve of the spells lethal power in return for a statistically unlikely result. Flip a coin. If heads, the caster is treated as if they rolled the maximum damage on the spell they cast. If tails, the caster is treated as if they rolled the minimum damage on the spell they cast."
107,"The spirit of a legendary warrior possesses the caster's body forcing him to bellow ""^AllRandomBattleCries^"" that echoes across the area. All creatures within 100 feet of the caster are greatly inspired by the sheer passion of the mighty roar and gain advantage on the next attack roll they make before the end of their next turn."
108,"The surge creates a rapid shifting of the water molecules around the caster creating a dense cloud of water vapor. A dense fog rises up from the ground, heavily obscuring everything within a ten foot radius centered on the caster. The low flying cloud lasts for 2d4 rounds before dissipating."
109,"The surge of eldritch power disrupts the nature of reality and interrupts the rapid oxidation of nearby materials in the exothermic chemical process of combustion. All mundane fires within 100 feet of caster are extinguished."
110,"The surging energy swirls about the caster in an ever increasing vortex until it explodes outward leaving him untouched. All other creatures within ten feet of the caster are knocked back ten feet as a result of the blast."
111,"The surging magic flooding through the caster's body stresses his body as if he was physically exerting himself to his very limits. The caster become exhausted as if he had been performing heavy labor for hours or went a night without sleep."
112,"The surging magic supercharges the caster's metabolism and natural healing factor to an extreme level. For the next minute, the caster regains 1 hit point at the start of each of his turns, healing him even if he is unconscious or dying."
113,"The target is overwhelmed by the dark and twisting nature of voodoo magic and finds their physical formed drastically changed. The target is transformed into the shape of a squirrel with solid black fur with the exception of a white skull shaped pattern on its head. The target retains his personality and mental faculties but is otherwise a squirrel with one single hit point. The transformation lasts until the end of the target's next turn or until the target takes any sort of damage whereupon he reverts back and any damage exceeding one hit point is carried over to his normal form. The target's equipment merges into his new form and becomes indestructible and unusable until he changes back at which time everything is returned to normal."
114,"The wild magic feeds on the caster's life force to further damage the target. The caster suffers one point of hit point damage per level (Or 10% of maximum health or other equivalent amount) and the target is dealt twice that amount of damage in addition to the damage they were dealt as part of the spell."
115,"The wild magic is spawned and grows in power but does not surge as it normally does and seems to be waiting for something. The next creature who successfully damages the caster with a spell or attack before the start of the caster's next turn must roll on this table and the surge is treated as if they were the caster. If it should be a physical attack, change the wording of the surge from caster to wielder and spell to attack."
116,"The wild magic sparks a mutation in the caster's brain, spontaneously evolving and developing (But not perfecting) his latent physic potential. The caster can focus on a living creature he can see within 60 feet and attempt to dominate their mind. The caster selects his strongest mental attributes (Intelligence, Wisdom Charisma, etc) and the target selects its own and they both roll against each other (As if they were arm wrestling with their minds) adding their ability modifiers to the results. The creature with the greater result wins the battle of wills and is able to immediately direct the other creature to move up to its regular move speed and make one melee or ranged attack. The winner can choose to cause the looser to attack itself which automatically hits and deals normal attack damage. The newly grown neurons in the caster's brain die after being used and he loses the physic ability."
117,"The wild magics spins and twists the nature of the spell, rendering its intended purpose completely worthless. The target suffers no damage or negative effect of any sort by the spell and is instead healed for an equal amount of hit points the spell would have dealt in damage. If they would have been healed by the spell, they instead suffer the amount healed as hit point damage."
118,"Unnatural energy surges through the caster's body forcing a terrifying mutation. The caster feels a painful itching sensation along his spine and four spider legs each twice as long as an arm burst out of his back, bypassing armor and clothing. The caster has complete control over the legs and can use them to move up, down and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving his hands free. The caster's climb speed using the arachnid legs is equal to his normal walking speed. The legs last for one hour before retracting back into the caster's body."
119,"The shifting winds of magic storm together and the caster is able to guide the various gusts into one solid object of their choosing. The caster can conjure up an inanimate object in their hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that he can see within ten feet of him. This object can be no larger than five feet on a side and weigh no more than 15 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that he has seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light with the brightness of a candle. The object retains its form until it takes more than one point of damage or for 24 hours, at which point its forms degrades and the sorcerous zephyrs rejoin the great maelstrom of magic."
120,"The caster is able to weave the various threads of raw magic around him into a substantial illusion, disguising his true form. The caster is able to make himself (Including clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on his person) look like different person for a period of up to eight hours or until the caster chooses to dismiss the illusion. He can choose to seem one foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between but cannot change his body type and must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. The changes wrought by this surge fail to hold up to physical inspection and are purely illusionary."
121,"The wild and chaotic nature of the surging magic grants the caster insight into the lives of wild creatures. For the next eight hours, the caster gains the empathic power to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts and animals. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at a minimum, beasts can share information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. The caster might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for him, at the DM's discretion."
122,"The spell is unexpectedly loud and everyone within ten feet of the caster (Including himself) takes thunder damage equal to a dagger and the spell can be heard up to 600 feet away."
123,"The spell triggers a minor temporal flux, creating a slight haze around the caster that glitters with chronomatic power. The wielder does gain a fleeting moment of control over the shifting aeonic energies and can use the surge to accelerate his reactions or delay his target's responses. The caster can harness the temporal flux in and choose one of two options to take effect; 1, The caster can hasten himself, gaining the highest initiative result and placing himself first in the initiative order out all creatures involved. 2, The caster can slow the target, causing the target to acquire the lowest initiative result, placing the target last in the initiative order out all creatures involved. Both effects begin on the next round of initiative and last until the end of the current combat. If there is no current initiative order, the wielder can instead choose to grant himself advantage, or grant the target disadvantage on initiative checks made for the next hour."
124,"The caster immediately losses their reflection and no longer appears in mirrors. If the caster gets this result again, the effect is canceled and he can be seen in reflections again."
125,"The caster's spell is accidentally empowered by means the arcane practice of Metamagic. Roll a Random Unique Metamagic Option and the spell that triggered the Wild Surge is improved by that effect. Reroll a result that cannot be applied the the spell at the DM's discretion. Sample Metamagic Option: ^UniqueMetamagicOptions^"
126,"Echos of mana drift around the caster's form waiting to be manipulated into the framework of a supernatural event. The caster is aware of the nature of the untapped mana and how it will affect his next spell. Roll on the Unique Metamagic Options and the next spell the caster performs within the next minute benefits from the option's effect. Sample Metamagic Option: ^UniqueMetamagicOptions^"
