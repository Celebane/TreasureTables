1,"A worn mercenary banner consisting of one rusty old spearhead atop a long wooden shaft. Five feet down from the head there rests a cross-piece four feet long tied to the shaft. From that hangs flag itself; A field of scarlet with nine hanged men in black and six yellow daggers in the upper left and lower right quadrants, respectively, while the upper right quadrant features a shattered skull and the lower left boasts a bird of prey astride a severed head. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize it as the Standard of the Black Company a free mercenary company who can trace their history back hundreds of years through their well-documented archives."
2,"A corrupted magic charm made of the skull a human who died in terror and with regrets. The bone is wrapped with dried kelp and algae, and the skull's forehead and dome is inscribed with strange sigils made from flower pigments. The entire bonecharm hums with power, creating a faint but distinctive 'song' that the spiritually perceptive can hear."
3,"A scroll covered with depictions of constellations."
4,"A shattered mask, once belonging to an ecclesiastic of the occult. Though broken this mask still retains a trace of its original purpose. It hums with faint whispers when worn. They demand an offering."
5,"A one gallon cask of Brewer's Pudding, an alcoholic “drink” so thick that the bartender needs to cut it like a loaf of bread to serve it. Bartenders typically put it in a bowl with lager poured over top, which slowly changes the “drink's” consistency similar to that of pudding. More squalid taverns sometimes serve it between slices of bread as a sandwich."
6,"A gnarled pipe smells strongly of cinnamon and fish, disturbing your digestion. Its bowl has constellations etched around it."
7,"A small, ragged figure crafted from human bone and hair, posed as though shading its eyes to see a long distance."

13,"A psaltery made from the darkest ebony wood. Its back is slightly curved with an indentation in the base so that it sits nicely on the player's lap. Inlayed in its face is a twisted branch covered in beautiful cherry blossoms. As the instrument is played the blossoms seem to fall away to reveal that the branch is not a branch at all but the bony hand of a skeleton."
14,"An ornate lacquered box containing a set of spoons, thirteen in number. Each is topped with a tiny figure that represents one of the Immortal Heroes of an eastern cult that is thought to be extinct. In that cult, the spoons are considered a valuable prize that proves the courage and skill of its members. The set would be decently valuable to a collector or otherwise interested buyer."
15,"An alabaster vase that has bas-relief figures of goddesses in skimpy clothing in provocative poses. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the goddesses are in fact the handmaidens of the Martyr Prophet and even to depict them clothed is a right arrogated to the Prophet's priesthood. The vase itself would be counted a blasphemy by the Prophet's followers."
16,"An oil lamp no larger than two cupped hands that's both delicate and fearful. Unlike more common lamps of brass or even common earthenware, the lamp is forged of hair-thin and glittering black iron, cool to the touch. It bears a single looped handle, and is covered in finely rendered etchings of arabesques and stylized wings."
17,"A number of sealed oval tins containing fillets of true monkfish in brine. The fish's bland pale flesh travels very well and is an imperishable as a saint's, hence its name. The fillets are filling an nourishing and there are enough tins to equate to 2d4+1 days' worth of trail rations."
18,"A large, cracked, spiral horn of some great beast, bound in silver and caked in blood. When blown, hot winds and swirling sands erupt from the mouth. All who hear the horn's call are urged to fight with the unrelenting fury of desert storm."
19,"A cerulean-blue semi-solid stone that is nearly translucent, and shines with an internal blue light."
20,"An onyx hair pin topped with a golden sphere accented by ivory flowers. It's covered in dust and the sphere is a bit oxidized, but with some proper cleaning it might be a suitable gift for the daughter of a noble."
21,"A black-green beeswax candle decorated with carvings of birds. The wick seems to be made out of gold threads. It faintly smells of ash and seawater."
22,"A constantly-shifting jigsaw puzzle made of of muscle and viscera."
23,"A dull green glass bottle, filled with transparent oil that rolls about like the sea's tides. Its label, written in Undercommon, reads “Immortality.” It is sealed with a deep black cork, and if opened reeks of skunk spray."
24,"A small stone that ticks evenly like a finely wound clock. Everyone who hears the stone becomes convinced that the stone must remain locked away or something very bad will happen."
25,"A commemorative porcelain plate of the last royal wedding."
26,"A jigsaw puzzle consisting of occult symbols that when fully completed opens a portal to that which the user desires most in the world. There are three pieces missing."

29,"A wide iron-studded dog collar."
30,"A sealed one gallon cask filled with a smoky, spicy spirit akin to weaker tequila. This aperitif is made from a flowering cactus found deep in the deserts heart.

If overindulged, it could even dislodged repressed memories, forgotten dreams, and other things forgotten (deliberately or otherwise)."
31,"A gilded wineglass fashioned from a human skull and set with lapis lazuli."
32,"A set of seven humanoid shaped obsidian pendants."

36,"A bloodstained scrap of parchment with a list of several names, including a couple of the PC's. All but one of the non-PC names are crossed out."
37,"A small silver bracelet fashioned in the style of a serpent with two small cyan-colored stones for eyes."
38,"A beautiful, multicolored glass sculpture that seems to take different shapes depending on the angle it is viewed from. From one angle, a mother and child, from another a proud warrior, all in vibrant color and exquisite detail. There are eight distinct scenes visible, one from each cardinal direction."
39,"A delicate tea set made of beautifully shaped glass. Each cup has been blown to look like a pair of child-sized hands clasped together, and the tea pot itself has the appearance of a cloaked human female kneeling in offering. Her hands reaching outwards act as the spout for the pot, and her pulled back hood acts as the lid. No liquid ever flows out of the teapot unless one of the cups in the set is directly beneath the spout."

44,"A small, golden chime, tied with a red ribbon around the handle, that rings softly of its own accord with a bittersweet melody. It makes those who hear it think of sunlight on a coastline that they've never seen, holding the hand of someone they've never known."
45,"A battered tin kettle, slightly warm to the touch. Any liquid placed into the kettle will become something almost, but not quite, exactly nothing like tea."
46,"A pair of goggles that allow the bearer to see from the point of view of a random reef fish in some far off sea."
47,"A black and purple scale of some enormous horror of the far realm."
48,"A thick piece of leather on which was branded a prayer of contrition. It says that it is not enough to ask for absolution, penitence must be forced upon the impure. Some sins can only be forgiven with consecrated flame."
49,"A stoppered, green glass bottle wrapped in grimy stained leather and cord. It is filled with an inferior moonshine containing alcohol distilled in the worst possible conditions. The liquor tastes worse than it looks, but provides a small degree of resistance to the horrors of daily life"

63,"A rose quartz paperweight shaped like a crushing fist."
64,"A toy horse carved from bone."

69,"A fist sized ball of melted copper coins."

74,"A bone pipe carved with intricate crimson sigils; its smoke appears as writhing shades of the damned."

Those who have been crossed off have recently have their graves' plundered, their bodies stolen. Further investigation still reveals that these were all jurors in the trial of Isabella Rasping, a necromancer convicted of using a zombies as murder weapons during the infamous “Meatpuppet Murders” two centuries ago. She was executed for the crime by her own creations. Isabella has returned as a revenant with unfinished business; she maintains her innocence and believes she can now prove it, and so is gathering the previous jurors for a kind of “retrial.“"

77,"A bandolier from which hang a half dozen small securely stoppered flasks. Each is filled with a noxious substance, preserved at the height of its foulness: Human diarrhea, spoiled milk, vomit, cat urine, skunk stink glands and rotting fish. The flasks are flimsy and designed to break apart when they hit something solid and each stopper has a small eye-hook screwed into the cork.
