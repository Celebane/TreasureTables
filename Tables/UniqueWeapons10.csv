1,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ whose bearer suffers from enhanced pangs of conscience whenever he contemplates or undertakes a malevolent act."
2,"A bludgeoning implement (Mace statistics) made of dense black iron wrought in the shape of the holy symbol of the forgotten deity. Both symbol and weapon, the seal is rusted and filthy. A symbol of infinity, the seal is a faint shadow of its former self, but the etchings pulse when blood slicks its face. It is theorized by scholars that should a creature be drained of blood by use of this tarnished seal, the chosen individual could slip more easily from their ephemeral form into the next world."
3,"Two dozen polished throwing stars that catch the light as they spin. Each one is an almost unbroken blade: a small heavy center, five broad, bright blades, gaps behind and between them where the wielder would hold it."
4,"A polished bone knife, curved and wicked like a ceremonial dagger. The weapon was created through a masterful combination of workmanship, with blood sorcery woven into the blade. Knowledgeable PC's can determine that the bone comes from the back leg of a swamp dragon."
5,"A hunting bow (Shortbow statistics) made of cherry wood with a grip wrapped in bat leather."
6,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ that is neither tall nor short, neither brand new nor well worn, not weighty nor light, and neither sturdy nor delicate. Its design not complex or simple, neither familiar or unknown, not gruesome nor merciful and not distasteful or elegant. The object is not so much of one quality that it becomes its opposite, Its form is not expressible nor ineffable, not arcane nor mundane and not a tool of heroes or villains. The weapon not this nor that and is purely, simply and wholly itself."
7,"An antique bronze heavy pickaxe whose head that smells like deep, wet earth."
8,"A rapier three feet in length with a blade that shines like a mirror. The weapon is slender in much the same way that the hope of a one-armed man hanging from a tuft of grass on the edge of a cliff is slender. The sword has a twisted, gold-decorated basket hilt wrapped around a crystal the colour of a cloudless sky. Four purple glass eyes encircled the pommel, each facing in a different direction. Sometimes, in the flickering light of a dying candle or summer rain, it almost seemed as if they are watching the bearer."
9,"A rapier with a long, thin blade describing a slight curve, its edge cruel enough to bite through steel. When drawn, the whispers from the scabbard is loud enough to cut through a moment's silence. Etched into the handguard is a warning; “The Blade Itself Incites To Violence”."
10,"An antique longsword with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt. The blade constantly emanates a thick white mist that instills fleeting feelings of bleakness, sorrow and hopelessness if inhaled."
11,"A bastard sword that rests within a black leather sheath. When drawn, it sheds a soft green glow from the green steel of the blade. Matching black leather winds around the handle and the pommel creating a beautiful angelic face."
12,"A battleaxe made of solid darksteel that is heavier than it looks and tricky to wield but guaranteed to last."
13,"A beautiful elven scimitar made with a flowing design. The smooth, wooden grip curves slightly outward away from the wielder and is covered in light green patterns. The pommel is somewhat bell-shaped and made of steel. No guard separates the grip from the blade, only a thin, slanted piece of steel. Below the grip, the first eight inches of the blade is not edged at all, the back of the blade just above the grip having a slight thorn of steel, the same design being found on the edged side of the blade, roughly seven inches from the grip. These steel 'thorns' protruding from the blade add to the general naturistic “branch-like” look of the sword. The rest of the blade is gracefully curved and is often decorated with Elvish scrollwork."
14,"A beautiful, jewel-handled stiletto (Dagger statistics). The blade shimmers with an ugly green tint."
15,"A bone handled dagger with a keen blade honed to a razor sharpness."
16,"A brace containing a dozen identical throwing knives, each with a straight blade of dark iron with just faint traceries of rust. The pommels are iron balls, with narrow strips of leather wound around the hilts."
17,"A compact, easy to hide kukri (Dagger or shortsword statistics) with an oily looking, blackened steely blade that flashes indigo rainbows. The inner edge is wickedly serrated. The pommel is made of ebonwood, and carved to resemble a snake with amethyst eyes."
18,"A composite longbow decorated with fluted ivory panels."
19,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ with small leaf on the grip, which briefly flashes with white light when anyone touches the handle."
20,"A dagger fashioned from a harpy's talon. A single prick from the blade's edge seems to suck the breath from the victim's lungs."
21,"A dagger of pristine quality and sharpness. The blade is a slightly tarnished silver that leads into golden cross-guard. The handle is made of a deep, black onyx ending in a golden pommel shaped to look like a crown."
22,"A dark ebony longbow inlaid with silver filigree and strung with a silver cord."
23,"A deceptively swift saber (Shortsword, longsword or scimitar statistics, DM's choice) imbued with aural magic. The blade resonates with every swordstrike, the clangs of its steel blade echoing a moment after their origin causing the sounds to harmonize with themselves."
24,"A fine battleaxe with silver-chased scrollwork on the blade behind the cutting edge."
25,"A fine red steel battleaxe engraved with a screaming skull on both sides of the blade."
26,"A finely balanced and weighted rapier with a hilt wrapped in electrum wire. In the pommel is set a leaf-green cabochon of jade, and a five-petalled flower picked out in rosy quartz ornaments the blade on either flat."
27,"A flail made of black steel engraved with depictions of human sacrifice. It has an abnormally long chain, and spikes are set into the pommel and handle as well as the striking head."
28,"A fullblade with a total length of six feet from pommel to tip and seemingly is made out of steel, featuring intricate carvings of fire and flames along the entire length of the blade. The hilt's guards are in the shape of dragon's claws and the pommel resembles a finely crafted roaring dragon's head with two small rubies as its eyes. The handle is wrapped in two layers of interwoven dark-brown and light-brown leather strips, contrasting with the sword's otherwise shiny, almost polished platinum-like look."
29,"A gorgeous lance made from a stout bough from the blessed Great Tree. Divine sigils are inscribed all along its length making it a weapon fit for the holiest of knights, allowing them to bring righteous fury to the wicked no matter where they might hide."
30,"A gorgeous longbow made of everbark from the Feywild, that flexes and shifts like a living entity."

32,"A heavy mace whose head is made from a single piece of roughly spherical, polished granite."

34,"A hollow quarterstaff, drilled through with numerous tiny holes that whistle when swung and spun."
35,"A huge, unwieldy two handed fullblade, engraved with a pithy maxim about the inevitability of death and encrusted the decorative silverwork depicting skulls, scales and law scrolls."
36,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ adorned with red spikes and engraved with images of chains and violent battles."
37,"A hybrid staff-shovel (Halberd statistics) of vague origin, the blade is ornately inlaid with a strange glowing blue material creating a sort of winged crest in the center, seems to be forged of a mysterious alloy steel, pale green in color. The haft appears to be inlaid with yet more of the blue material, and is of hickory wood, judging by the color and rigidness. At the opposite end of the haft, a trio of bleached songbird skulls hang, each with a small red orb in its beak."
38,"A lethal bullwhip made of leather with plaited nuggets of copper woven into the braids. The weapon glows with yellow light whenever it comes into contact with undead beings, giving the appearance of a lightning strike when the whip's tip connects with an undead target."
39,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ encrusted with bear teeth within the handle and sporting blood stains that cannot be removed."
40,"A quarterstaff of smooth white wood, capped at each end with a golden cross adorned with a multitude of ruby cabochons."
41,"A light crossbow made from a deep red-hued wood, strengthened by bands of wrought iron and carved with shallow markings that resemble flickering flames."
42,"A long thin greatclub that gets progressively wider towards the end. The octagonal weapon (Known as a kanabo or tetsubo) is made of a laminated oak slab embedded with dozens of steel rivets. Its handle is nearly a foot long and is obviously meant to be wielded with two hands."
43,"A longbow made from two antelope horns that have been seamlessly bound together at their bases. The bow is strung with golden hair from a lion's mane that is said to bring courage in battle."
44,"A longspear consisting of a single piece of polished hardwood, covered in gruesome carvings that glow faint green when brandished at an enemy."
45,"A longsword with a dual-edged and two-toned blade. The flats of the blade are a shiny copper while the edges appear to have a golden sheen. The blade is slightly curved, ending in a reversed, barb-like hook design typically seen on skinning knives for gutting and field dressing game."
46,"A longsword with a hilt made of a bright wood bound tightly with a white cloth. The guard and pommel are made of gold, simple and sleek in design. The blade is long and thin, metallic with a golden hue. When sunlight directly hits the blade it shimmers and looks to be completely made of gold."
47,"A longsword, plated in silver, bearing a blessing written in celestial by an angel. The weapon's beauty inspires hope in men, and evokes fear in the foul creatures of the night."
48,"A quarterstaff made completely of pink hued coral, on one end there is a large pearl."
49,"A pair of knuckledusters (Brass knuckle statistics) made of human jaws, but with the teeth all still attached at unnatural angles."
50,"A perfectly functional ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ crafted entirely from black iron and gnarled horn inscribed with foul seals and leering faces. Any cloth or leather components are crafted from demonhide. The weapon is always warm to the touch and celestials find its presence repulsive."
51,"A quarterstaff fashioned from twisted iron ending in a large claw at the top. It holds a geode, which is cut in half to expose the iridescent violet crystals within."
52,"A ^RandomMeleeWeapons^ with the symbol of a screaming face stamped on the grip. When whirled vigorously above the wielder's head for a few seconds, the weapon emits a high-pitched keening sound not dissimilar to a scream."
53,"A masterfully made greatsword with a straight crossguard and spherical pommel. The blade has a wide fuller to lighten the overall weight and the center of the guard is adorned with the symbol of a Kingfisher, wings engraved to be outspread along the crossguard. The pommel bears the engraving of a rose."
54,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ heavily ornamented with heavily feathered wings. Its crossguard is a pair of them, its hilt is an overlapping procession of them, and its blade appears to be two of them pressed together. Wounds struck by it gush a strange red gas instead of blood."
55,"A one-handed woodsman's hatchet (Handaxe statistics) with a broad blade, a smooth wooden handle for a good grip, and its own leather scabbard for the head, which can be strapped to the bearer's belt. The hatchet is useful for chopping wood and serves as an excellent melee weapon."
56,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a mithril blade with a carved jade hilt and a white pearl pommel."
57,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a pommel made of a large round ruby. The well cut gemstone's interior is filled with a swirling black haze. When the weapon is used to kill an intelligent creature, the swirling intensifies as does a near-silent sound of muffled screaming."
58,"A ^RandomSwordTable^ with a shining, ornate guard and black corrugated hilt. The weapon rests in a lizard skin sheath meant to be worn over the shoulder."
59,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ obviously patched together from other items that are not at all related, but somehow seems to form a functional whole."
60,"A razor sharp dagger with a deep fuller running the entirety of the blade. It is designed to be able to painlessly cut its target and catch some of their blood for scrying purposes."
61,"A scimitar whose leather cup guard is made of some strange, squamous hide, and emblazoned with a copper disk sporting a monstrous, tentacled head. A similar head is attached to one side of the dark-stained wooden scabbard, while the other side is set with a monstrous, yellow glass eye. Both blade and scabbard have a dank, briny smell about them."

63,"A set of six ceramic throwing daggers with ragged edges. They seem to have been made out of a dinner plate."

65,"A silver dagger wrapped in a tight washcloth with a note tucked inside that reads; “I love you always. Stay safe. ~Nana”"
66,"A simple shortsword set with a blade of bleached bone. The handle is wrapped with a leathery material of questionable origin."

68,"A small pouch of blacks and dark blues made of fine silk. Within it rest a dozen finely tipped black darts, each with a slight curve that clang about the pouch."
69,"A stiletto dagger with a strong, triangular blade that tapers to a sharp point at the tip. The weapon is designed for thrusting, in particular to pierce armor such as leather or mail. Most cities, except those involved in a war, prohibit the carrying of a stiletto since it is an easily concealed weapon. Stilettos are narrow enough to be concealed in sword canes, belt pouches or up a sleeve."
70,"A stylish shortsword bearing a satin polished blade with multiple fullers and a wicked edge. The intricately carved handle is made from rosewood and ornamented with nickel-silver pins. The scabbard's style harmonizes engagingly with the sword's design. It's made from heavy, black leather and capped at each end with an embossed nickel-silver throat and chape."
71,"A tasteful and elegant longsword with a handle of lizard skin, a gold-plated crossguard and in the pommel a jasper the size of a pigeon's egg.

76,"An angular recurve bow comprised of a single willow branch. The bow appears well used, but is still in excellent condition. Archaic elven characters are inscribed on the inner side of the grip, characters which are so distantly related to modern elven that an average speaker can only tell that they are related, not what they mean. The string of the bow is as fine as spider silk, but incredibly strong; it seems to be unbreakable while attached to the bow, and removing it causes a new string to magically reform over the course of a minute in place on the bow."
77,"An archery case painted with brutal scenes of elephant hunting that contains 20 arrows."
78,"An eight foot long trident made almost entirely out of metal, except for the hand grips, which are straps of dark cured leather with white fur lining. The metal length of the trident is adorned by an elaborate motif of water and waves, seemingly made out of gold and silver. The three spikes are barren of any decoration, but each tip has a fishhook point at its end. The outer ones with one side facing outward, the inner one with two sides facing the other two spikes."

83,"Fangmask: A pair of simple metal plates held together by leather straps. It is designed to be worn around the face, obscuring the mouth and nose. Subtle hinges cause the mask to unfold when the bearer fully opens their mouth. This reveals twin fangs that are punctuated with extremely fine barbs. Even a feeble wearer is capable of punching through flesh, bone, and lesser armors when their bite strength is amplified by the mask's inner workings. The bearer is able to make a bite attack with the mask that deals damage equivalent to a dagger. Using the Fangmask is uses the same statistics and techniques as fighting with two weapons."
84,"Stiletto Shield: A small wooden shield with a special switch located on the inside grip. When triggered, four blades pop out from the edges of the shield, and one larger blade springs out from the middle. Triggering and retracting the blades is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon. When the blades are activated, the stiletto shield counts as a spiked shield in all respects."
85,"A steel-bladed shortsword with a hilt wrapped in black bat leather with silver wire. The blade is decorated with delicate scrollwork that seems to flow of its own volition. The blade tapers, widens, and tapers again in a “leaf” shape. The pommel is in the shape of a spike and screws off to reveal a hollow hilt large enough to fit a vial, small scroll, a handful of coins or other similar sized object."
86,"A straight-edge razor (Dagger statistics) with a handle inlaid with mother-of-pearl and set at one end with a small gem. The blade is engraved with the phrase “Fear the Edge of Pain”, the motto of a notorious serial killer who haunted the harbour and docks of Gallimstaal.

87,"A sturdy club that appears to be made from the taproot of a large plant."
88,"A two-handed mace of blackened steel with small silver inlays decorating the head and a copper band at the center of the shaft."
89,"A thick iron cleaver (Longsword statistics) that slices through the toughest of beast hides. This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that its battles were for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
90,"A two-handed sword with a cross hilt of forward sloping quillons known as a claymore (Greatsword statistics) commonly used among some mountain tribe clansmen. The blade is engraved with dwarvish runes reading; “This end toward enemy”“."
91,"A wakizashi (Swordshort statistics) whose blade is mottled black-on-red, with glowing yellow particles running between the onyx blotches. Its sheath is decorated in contrasting patterns and collars."
92,"An impressive maul forged from a single piece of cobalt. It is unadorned, except for a shallow-relief sculpture of an elephant's face on each side of the hammer's head. Its long haft is wrapped with a single strip of dragon leather that if unwrapped, reveals pictographs that tell the story of the weapon's forging."
93,"An occult rapier whose thin blade is covered in rivulets of raw eldritch power that ripple up and down its length."
94,"An odd scimitar that curves slightly and then recurves, in the form of an elongated letter S. The result is pretty but a pain to carry around, as it cannot rest in a regular scabbard."
95,"An old broadsword (Greatsword statistics) that looks like something out of a museum, with two red gemstones fitted into a silver-etched hilt. The weapon is almost as long as a full grown man."
96,"An ornate warpick decorated with carvings depicting a gnome knocking a goliath prone."
97,"An overly ornate (Bordering on gaudy) ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^, combining motifs from different cultures and groups into its own style."
98,"An unassuming cavalry sabre (Longsword statistics) with a hilt covered in leather the colour of a tropical sunset. When held and swivelled, the thin blade gently shimmers like a rainbow over tropical beach."
99,"An undecorated, army issued smallsword (Shortsword statistics) with an oval shell of a guard over the hilt. It is nothing special but has been kept in good condition."
100,"A delicately fashioned garrote made for small hands, fashioned from two ash wood handles with a cord made of braided vines. This weapon of murder was likely crafted and used by the graceful faire folk that live in the deep forests. Knowledgeable PC's will know that despite their small stature the fey and deceptively strong and vicious when angered in it is likely that this tool was used by a creature who hid in the tops of trees and simply jumped onto the backs of its victims and strangled them to death for doing nothing more than entering to deeply into the forest."
