1,"An eight-foot long pike with a broad “ox tongue” blade engraved with knotwork patterns."

10,"A wicker quiver containing Resolve: {Roll 5d6} arrows crafted entirely of hollowed bamboo, each with an extremely narrow point designed to slip between the ribs. Any archer can tell that these arrows are short-ranged, prone to breakage and that few warriors would choose to use them. These arrows have half the range of a typical arrow and can never be re-used after being shot. In the hands of a skilled bowman however, they are quite deadly and capable of penetrating straight through armor and into the lungs and creating sucking chest wound. The air quite literally escapes from the organ out through the hollow weapon. Whenever the wielder attacks a living, breathing creature with advantage and both rolls would hit, the target begins to feel their breath literally slip away and begins suffocating or drowning (As normal per your games rules). The target continues to not be able to breathe until a creature removes the arrow (Using an action equivalent to drawing a weapon) and a successful Medicine skill check is performed on the target (Equivalent to stabilizing a dying creature) or the target regains at least one hit point from any source."
