A pair of sturdy cross quillons rest under the blade preventing an impaled target from working its way down the length of the polearm's ash wood shaft.
26,"A ^RandomSword^ crafted from an ancient relic, it's more akin to a giant piece of a shattered tooth on a hilt rather than an actual sword.

29,"A falcata (Shortsword statistics) with a forward curved blade with a single cutting edge on the concave side. The blade widens near the tip, narrowing in the middle and the shape of the blade distributes the weight in a way so as to give the weapon the momentum of an axe while maintaining the versatility of a sword. The hilt is hook-shaped to help prevent the sword from flying out of the wielder's hand in the heat of battle."

35,"A crescent-shaped blade (Dagger statistics) on the end of a long, metal tube that is worn over the forearm. A handle inside the tube allows the wielder to maintain a hold on the weapon in the heat of battle. The weapon is versatile, capable of slashing, stabbing, and blocking opponent's blows, while the shape of the blade is such that even slight contact could inflict a serious wound. The weapon takes two hands and an entire round to don the weapon over the arm or release it by pulling it off but while wielded, the weapon cannot be disarmed short of actual dismemberment. In order to properly use this uncommon weapon, the wielder must have practiced with it for at least one hour in the past week. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that the weapon is known as a “Scissor” in the gladiatorial community and is not often found outside of a pit-fighting arena."
36,"A bardiche (Halberd statistics) with a long, cleaver-like blade attached to a relatively short wooden pole. The blade is attached to the shaft by means of two sockets, one on top of the pole and the other at the base of the blade.

The single-handed hilt has a cruciform-guard and a pommel. The sword is primarily used for thrusting as its narrow, but sturdy tip is ideal in finding the gaps of plate armor. Its light design allows the blade to be held with a hand, allowing a more agile, aggressive and close-ranged fighting style compared to traditional broadswords."
42,A longspear whose wooden shaft was carved from a tree branch and is topped with an iron spearhead with a rounded tip and a narrow blade.

The weapon is known as a Sica and its angled blade is designed to reach around the shields of opponents. With the tip pointing up, the sword can reliably catch the bottom of opponent's helmets, allowing the wielder to force the blade upwards through the jaw and into the brain. In order to properly use this uncommon weapon, the wielder must already be proficient in standard shortswords and longswords and have practiced with the Sica for at least one hour in the past week. A trained wielder can easily hook around an opponent's shield as if it wasn't even there and attacks made with this weapon ignore any defensive benefits that an opponent's shield would normally provide."
55,A pike with a serrated blade that seems to bite deeper with each wriggle of its victim's final throes. The reviled weapon bears the royal sigil of the ancient wyvern riders.
56,"The symbol of an earthworm is etched into the grip of the ^RandonNon-AmmunitionWeapons^. Whenever the bearer lingers on earthen soil, worms, beetles, ants and other vermin and insects squirm to the surface.

57,"A keenly honed longspear with the name “Sharkdoom” etched along its length. The weapon is tipped with a heavy, four flanged spearhead with a spiraling blade.

64,"A long, heavy quarterstaff carved all over with minuscule wizened faces, all smiling in a cheery, friendly manner."
65,"A rapier that more than likely crafted and used by the graceful faerie folk that live in the deep forests. The elegant weapon has hilt and guard made entirely out of a single piece of ash wood that seems to have been shaped with magic rather than carved with tools. The wood is decorated with thin strips of highly polished bone inlay that shimmer brightly in the thin rays of light that penetrate the forest's dense tree canopy.

The weapon is made from wavy blue nacre stripped from some giant clam, which glows an iridescent blue. It's hilt and scabbard are made from red-lacquered wood, simple yet elegant.

87,"A ^RandomSword^ whose hilt has been exquisitely crafted to resemble a screaming banshee, with the blade emerging from her gaping maw.

93,"A ^RandomSword^ with a narrow triangular blade that tapers to a point. The quality steel is tinted blue and the hilt is adorned in fine elvish-style silver artwork with a sapphire set in the pommel. Its sheath is wooden, covered with leather, and gilded with silver in leafy vine patterns."

95,"A jian (Longsword statistics) with a flat, round, disc-shaped steel pommel, a white ray skin grip and a low-profile steel cross-guard in the shape of a tiger and a horse flanking the blade. The blade itself is a long, narrow and double-edged with beautifully calligraphed characters. The bronze banded scabbard is primarily white ray skin trimmed with black gloss enamel."
96,"A tall staff carved from the branch of a cankered tree and reinforced with the bones of a plague victim.

100,"Battle Instrument: A masterfully crafted ^RandomMusicalInstruments^ that is a combination of deadly weapon and musical instrument. The weapon's cutting edge, sharpened point or sturdy bludgeoning side is naturally incorporated into the look and feel of the musical tool. The apparatus is constructed from extremely resilient materials and the instrument is never damaged as a result of casual use in combat. A bearer must be proficient in both the instrument and the weapon in order to properly utilize the battle instrument. A talented wielder can easily use the multipurpose object as either a weapon or instrument (And is considered “armed” when holding it) but it can only function as one or the other in a given round. —Note: I suggest using the weapon statistics of whatever weapon seems most appropriate. A flute can have a pointed end or bladed side (Dagger or shortsword statistics), a didgeridoo could have metal banding or a sharpened end (Club or shortspear statistics) or a lute could have a crescent blade on one side or be made of wood of strings of a enchanted wood that will bend and flex without breaking (Battleaxe or shortbow statistics)."
