2,"A cup-hilted rapier crafted by the fey and decorated with a fantastic depiction of the Wild Hunt.

When wielded in combat, the wielder can hear the bellowing sounds of a hunting horn blasting in the distance, rousing him into a murderous frenzy."
3,"A venerable looking longbow that sounds out a musical note each time it fires an arrow. The deep resonating sound is part of an ancient, secret song that when played in full, unlocks secret doorways to places long forgotten."

6,"A dark bladed battleaxe with rippling patterns in the metal and a handle fashioned to look like four figures each shackled to the haft with their faces wracked with anguish. An insightful bearer experiences the unsettling feeling that the weapon can be used to steal souls. Whenever an intelligent being is killed by the battleaxe, one of the four figures on the handle changes shape to create a perfect replica of the victim appearance but shackled to the weapon and writhing in agony."
7,"A longspear of black stained wood tipped with a wickedly sharp, white bone blade. Being struck with the weapon causes a sudden feeling of intense grief that is quickly overcome by the pain of the wound."
8,"A wedge-shaped club with an oval cross-section that widens near the end and iron bands around the tip to increase its lethality. The weapon weighs about six pounds, two feet long, constructed from ash which was then fire-hardened and sealed in beeswax. The weapon sports a distinct pommel, expertly carved to resemble a human face contorted with rage."
9,"An all-steel mace with a rapier-like hilt and hand guard. The business end sports a flanged design and bears small openings in the head that produces an array of whistling noises when swung."
10,"A scimitar forged from a single piece of alchemically strengthened silver, whose pommel prominently displays a distinctive heraldry of a were-lion creature. The weapon is old and it seems as though it was seen countless battles and has been expertly repaired on many different occasions. Its matching scabbard bears the following inscription tooled into the worked leather, “Every scratch tells a story, and every notch has a name. Generations have held this blade. You shall not disappoint them.”"
11,"A sinister-looking black longbow with weblike patterns carved into the wood. The thin, yet strong, silken bowstring is almost invisible to anyone but the wielder."

15,"A menacing shortsword with a blood groove that travels down the full length of the well-oiled blade, which turns into cruel saw-like ridges near the guard. The handle is wrapped tightly in simple leather which has been splattered with the blood of countless victims. Etched into the blade in a gothic style is the word “Veritas”."

19,"An ostentatious rapier with intricate, organic sweepings of polished steel shield that protect the wielder's hand. A round, pink tourmaline is set into the front of the crossbar.  The scabbard is soft, pale leather decorated with a pattern of leaves. Examination reveals naked, dancing women among the leaves, along with vaguely phallic clusters of grapes."
20,"A short, hafted, sharpened goad with a heavy, rounded tip and a large pointed hook. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize it as an ankus, a tool commonly used for managing elephants. In addition to serving as a pachyderm prod, the solid steel implement serves as a perfectly functional mace."
21,"A short thick knife known as a seax with a broad spine and rounded edge. Used with either a hacking or stabbing movement and favored amongst barbarian tribes as a sidearm if an axe or sword is lost. The dagger's thick blade make wounds more severe than knives of a similar length."

The head of the scepter is comprised of a human skull covered with alchemically hardened, gold plating. Two onyx gems are set into the golden eye sockets, glittering with what any observer would swear was malicious intelligence."
29,"A silvered short-sword forged in a style of a faraway city. Time has not been kind to it, but it refuses to retire. If only it could talk…"
30,"A slick shortsword with a red guard. There is a small knot made out of red linen on the pommel."
31,"A twisted ^RandomSwordTable^ seemingly made of non-melting ice. A tortured humanoid shape made of stone (Arms outstretched) makes the handle and pommel."
32,"A scimitar whose blade is made of a dragon's tooth. The long curve of treacherous enamel was pulled from the head of some long dead wyrm some time ago. A grip has been worked into the root of the wicked tooth, curved into the opposing direction. It allows for biting sweeps of the blade, that cut deep and with great force."
33,"A battleaxe covered in elaborate and well maintained designs. The weapon is fully functional yet bears hints of ceremonial, official or noble importance and would look at home strapped to a warlord's hip. To split wood with this weapon would be sacrilege, the tool has but one purpose, and that is war."
34,"A longbow, black as night and built of a material unlike any the bearer has ever encountered. The bow gently writhes in the bearer's hands, and the wielder could swear he occasionally hear whispers in the back of his mind while using it."

37,"A simple dagger whose blade has a crude carving of a rat etched into one side, and on the reverse it says “We may be small but we are legion”. Knowledgeable PC's have heard of legends that describe weapons similar to this being used by a band of misfits, lost children and forgotten souls led by one known as “The Rat King”."
38,"A rustic quiver containing a dozen arrows made from roughhewn chunks of bone with strange runes carved into them."
39,"A massive, intricately crafted composite bow of dwarven make. Mostly carved from bone, from some unidentifiable creature's ribs or tusks of some kind, with a thick metal chain acting as a bowstring. It is plain just by looking at the contraption that it requires a strong arm to fire."
40,"An iron quarterstaff belonging to an evil cult that worships an archfiend of ^EvilDomains^. The head of the staff doubles as a brand to anoint the newly inducted."
41,"A handaxe carved from an enormous pearl bound with a simple leather wrapping. The weapon glimmers slightly, even in pitch darkness."

49,"A polished quarterstaff made of birch wood. The staff is capped on one end with a small steel carving of a wide scalloped seashell."
50,"A long shaft of wood with a massive, jagged ruby set in the end. The longspear looks more practical than beautiful, but the deadly tip is bathed in a ferocious and elegant crimson light."
51,"A simple-looking dao (Longsword statistics) with a paper-thin blade and a long line of silk tied to the hilt, depicting a bubbling stream with flowering lilies floating on the water."
52,"A pair of identical sais (Dagger statistics), both beautifully crafted so the center prong resembles a serpent. Green leather covers the handle and the tines are fashioned to look like recoiling vipers, fangs bared."
53,"A sickle that always looks well-polished and new, its blade is covered with light etchings of satyrs dancing."

83,"A cutlass (Shortsword, longsword or scimitar statistics DM's choice) once owned by reavers, pirates and vicious mercenaries.

97,"A polished gray hiking stick made of hickory wood. The staff while not sturdy enough for use as a bludgeoning weapon itself, has a leather thong at one end, suitable for use as a sling. A bearer proficient in slings can wield the sling-staff as a two handed weapon which increases the sling's damage die by one step to the next largest die. The sling-staff cannot be wielded one handed.

98,"A greatclub made of ash wood wrapped in bands of steel."
99,"A wicked-looking fullblade that has a blade of steel and a hilt wrapped in adamantium wire. The blade is inscribed with the name The Fate of Arrogance.

The weapon rests in a scabbard of hickory wood, inlaid with whale tooth."

In the center of the guard rests an amber gem that sparkles in the sunshine. In the pommel lies a large seed that if planted slowly grows into a small bush with black stems and purple leaves. The sword's pommel seed eventually regenerates over the course of a month."
