1,"A wax stamp that changes insignia depending on the proximity of the nearest royal blooded individual."
2,"A hollowed, curled demon horn. When blown, it sounds like tortured screaming."
3,"A strange note, written on bloody human flesh. Examining the ragged piece of flesh reveals a reeking stench of sweat and tears. A series of crude gouges in the skin pulsate and seep blood. They seem to form a pattern, and the reader can just make out the following: “Beware the Avatar of the Crawling Chaos, the Heart of Darkness knows no mercy.”"
4,"A sharp tooth as long as a human hand. Looking at it makes a humanoid creature uneasy in a deeply primal way."
5,"A glowing orb that has a hidden button on it. Pressing it reveals several smaller variously colored orbs inside, which escape the orb and start to orbit it, like planets around a star. Pressing the button again causes the spheres to retreat back into the glowing one."
6,"A sealed glass petri dish holding a small ooze like substance labeled, “Experiment #1”."
7,"A perfume vinaigrette shaped like a tiny, long amphora. Made of some silvery metal and worked all over with tarnished curlicue. If shaken, the vinaigrette rattles, as if filled with large grains. Its lid clicks open, allowing, from the grated neck, a mossy odor of chypre. A scent neither in vogue nor disliked, today. The scent does not run out, nor fade."
8,"A long scroll made out of weathered parchment with a broken wax seal. The material is covered in strange diagrams of inhuman anatomy at crazy, disjointed angles."
9,"A piece of parchment torn from a notebook, written on it are a list of names and causes of death."
10,"A lead slate, five inches by four, and quite worn, with five lines of text written across the back in small, punched holes. Each line appears to be the same phrase, simply repeated in five languages. The first, punched out in the symbols and tongue of Ancient Dwarven, which is still legible today, reads “What wrought we here should be forgot.”"
11,"An elongated, angular mask designed for masquerade balls. It features a large pair of velveted antlers and a crown of lustrous ivy."
12,"An antique pipe that has a carved parrot wearing a tricorn hat perched on its bowl. The smoke that billows from the chamber is colored a wild mix of reds, blues, and greens."
13,"A small jar of a sweet smelling green paste. When applied to the tender inflamed skin, it soothes and numbs the pain, replacing it with a pleasant tingling sensation for a few hours."
14,"A coffin shaped scrollcase filled to the brim with loose sheets of yellowed paper. They are covered with maddened scrawl and diagrams and calculations and degenerate ranting."
15,"An oil lamp made from a turtle's shell embellished with gold leaf and a copper handle."
16,"A bronze bowl engraved with pagan figures, one side shows a city at war and another shows it at peace. The metal of the bowl is corroded, gone all green and black."
17,"A surgeon's amputation saw with a bone handle engraved with pictographs of burial rituals."
18,"Kolain Drop: A small tin canister containing a few dozen candies made from amber sugar, spun into a shape resembling the outline of a teardrop (Although a cynic might claim they look like candy nooses) and coated in dark chocolate. Licking a Kolain makes it harder to concentrate on sad memories for a short while, but finishing a whole drop while focusing on a specific memory accentuates the positive emotions of that memory and makes it easier to deal with the associated negative emotions."
19,"A prosthetic eye made of ivory and set with an opal iris. The eye whispers unintelligible breathy words to the bearer in the dark and if worn during sleep, the bearer suffers from terrible, barely remembered Random Nightmares."
20,"A beautifully crafted silver pocket watch that functions but the hands tick backwards."
21,"A ship in a bottle suspended above water that sloshes and froths rhythmically, regardless of whether or not it is moved or shaken. The ship bobs cheerfully in the water and is relaxing to look upon."
22,"A bassoon with the bell joint carved into the shape of a dragon's head that shoots smoke rings when played."
23,"An iron mask resembling a skull with its mouth sowed shut."
24,"A large tapestry made from an unidentifiable thread. Strange symbols and stranger images fill every space, chaotically strewn about the thread work with no apparent pattern. No centralized theme or focus can be made out, but the likeliness of several important figures and deities can be made out amongst alien creatures and other, unknown people. The tapestry is unfinished on one side, making it obvious that the project is still a work in progress."
25,"A large hourglass which in place of sand, has dozens of tiny teeth of all shapes and kinds flowing between the two bulbs, each one glowing with a faint red light. The flow of the device switches directions at random times for no visible reason, with no bulb ever holding all the teeth."
26,"A wanted poster that resembles one of the PC's but the hairstyle and colour are completely wrong."
27,"A freshly dead messenger raven with a tiny scroll tube tied to its leg. Within is a small parchment with some sort of coded battle report written on it."
28,"A fairly well made wooden mask that has been carved to resemble the facial features of the minor God of Random Domain. A creature actively wearing the mask see's the world through the eye holes with a slightly altered perception as if they are being subtly influenced by the nature of the God."
29,"A simple but finely crafted leather armband embossed with a branch-like pattern."
30,"A one gallon cask of a rare liquor known as Hag's Blood. A strong fruit wine with the hyphae of a fungus growing through it. It has to be fed a bit of sugar every year to keep the fungus alive, or else it just becomes a normal fruit wine. It is drank slowly, and induces hallucinogenic effects in the drinker."
31,"A wide, flat bronze bracelet carved with couples entwining."
32,"A large brass medal of military service. It once bore an intricate casting of a lion's head. But it has been polished smooth over many years."
33,"A small medicine bottle, halfway filled with a herbal remedy."
34,"A small portrait of a group of friends, all but one of them with a date written next to their name."
35,"A blue and gold diviner's scroll covered in text that change every morning at dawn. The writing is usually cryptic message about future events."
36,"An ocarina seemingly crafted from snowflake obsidian that produces some decently low notes and is shaped somewhat like an aquatic animal of some sort."
37,"A silver coin with a siren on heads and a banshee on tails. When the coin is flipped it will make ominous wailing sounds until the outcome is revealed."
38,"A brick taken from a haunted house. The brick grows sharp, jagged teeth at night which retract during the day."
39,"A small goldfish skeleton preserved in a clear glass orb."
40,"An amalgam of dozen small animal skulls, each from a different creature, all compressed and partly melted into a heavy, fist-sized ball of horror."
41,"A bag of glass eye marbles fashioned in various shades of blue, green, brown, and hazel. When a marble is rolled on the ground, it always appears to be looking at the creature who rolled it."
42,"A music box in the shape of a clockwork raven that sits atop a porcelain skull. Winding the mechanism plays an eerie tune, while the raven pecks the empty eye socket to the rhythm of the music"
43,"A small leather pouch filled with strong-smelling healing herbs."
44,"A leather wallet stamped with the holy symbol of a God of a Random Domain. It contains a set of certified identification papers denoting that the bearer is an ordained member of a religion who worships said Deity. The section containing the priest's physical description (Height, weight, sex, race, eye, skin and hair colour) is completely blank and could be filled in by anyone with half decent handwriting."
45,"A wooden, toy rocking horse, carved to look like a horse whose skin has been removed, muscles, tendons, and blood vessels are all intricately shown. In some areas, even those layers have been removed in favor of exposing parts of the horses skeleton."
46,"A simple lantern with a hood covering. The hood spins as the base plays a music box tune to reveal pictures of clawed monsters, winged demons, witches and wolves on the wall. Different hoods can be placed on to show different scenes."
47,"A carving of a boar made of quartz and no longer than a person's thumb."
48,"A clockwork dismembered hand wearing a white glove with an ornate signet ring and dress shirt cuff with gemmed cuff links. It moves around on its fingers when wound up."
49,"A handheld mirror with a cobalt border engraved with strange runes. Instead of your reflection, you see nothing but mist in its surface."
50,"A fire opal carved into a small coin. The obverse sigil is a picture of rainfall. The reverse is an elven phrase that translates to “Let us take what nature will not provide.”"
51,"A single small, filthy earring that when worn, allows the bearer to speak the language of the goblins, but only to say: “I don't actually speak Goblin. I only know that sentence, and this one explaining it.” The bearer is not granted the ability to understand the language and doesn't comprehend what they just said unless they are already fluent."
52,"A wooden relic carved from bronzewood, in the shape of a serpent. It can always adjust to fit snugly around the bearer's forearm. It writhes occasionally, when seen out of the corner of your eye."
53,"A travel case for a Random Musical Instrument. The case is made of hardwood covered in boiled leather sealed in beeswax with rubber seals around the opening. The inside is lined with velvet sheltering the instrument from the harshest jostling the bearer might endure. An adjustable carry strap allows the bearer to wear it in whatever manner is most comfortable for them. Whatever type of instrument the case is deigned to carry, the case contains one such musical device (Or a set of devices) within it."
54,"A shawl of beautiful rainbow color with lace frilled edges resembling clouds."
55,"A black coin with two grim sides. One side bears the staring visage of a spiral-horned woman with mean eyes. Its opposing face displays an eyeless skull. A tarry blackbird, ragged, follows the carrier of said coin at cautious distance, watching with fish's eyes."
56,"A branding iron the length of a human hand, whose business end is forged in the shape of the phrase: “Random Motto”. The brand could be used to stamp leather or flesh and might have been used by an individual or organization to mark its goods, armor or members."
57,"A brooch composed of three overlapping green-enameled nickel silver leaves secured together by rusted hinges. The enamel is cracked and dusty. If worn, the leaves click together; a sound reminiscent of clinking spurs on riding boots."
58,"A chunk of amber included by a blackened, fossilized thing curled up upon itself. It is big-headed and roughly humanoid, like a minute fetus, but has distinct ridges or spurs running down its curved spine."
59,"A clay whistle, shaped like a toothless, leering skull. With some practice, a user may develop a queer embouchure and play the thing, which requires a forceful blow into the cranium. It produces no music; only a high and rattling cry of human terror. A blood-curdling scream."
60,"A die with six sides. An inch square, and cut from decayed walrus ivory. The carved faces, their lines filled with dirt, are thus: A long-fingered hand, a thin eye, an acorn, a seven-pointed star, a spiny fish, and a rose in full bloom. When rolled, the fish consistently lands facing up."
61,"A dried serpent, coiled in a foggy crystal tube sealed with wax. A husk of a creature, like onion skins wrapped around brittle fishbones. A leak of ash and smothered cinders spills from a split in its long, desiccated gut."
62,"A glass jar, blue, sagging with the slow melt of ages. Within are three seeds, somehow not yet turned to dust. They are like those of a pumpkin, or squash, but are reddish and much pointier."
63,"A green, glass apple barely skinned with flaking gold leaf. Within, there are visible countless rivers of incredibly tiny veins, fibers, and seeds, as if a real apple were refashioned precisely as glass. Said seeds are glimmering red, perhaps rubies. The apple is profoundly strong and cannot easily break."
64,"A handheld fan with lightweight steel leaves. When fully opened on its creaking rivet, it forms three quarters of a circle. The leaves are spotted with delicate openwork in flowering geometric patterns, some of which have been eaten through by rust."
65,"A bright red, strip of cloth, stitched with images of a cheering crowd throwing garlands toward a chariot. It fits across the bearer's shoulder and then diagonally down their chest to reach their opposite hip."
66,"A strangely shaped piece of whittled driftwood with dozens of holes in it. When the correct hole is blown into, it mimics the sound of the ocean."
67,"A large locket, its case and door crafted from faceted, cracked, yellowed glass cut like a rectangular gem. Its interior frame holds not a painting, nor an etching, but a fuzzy, silver mirror. The mirror, when polished, has a hidden effect: If one looks into it, centers their face in the frame, and focuses upon the background, they may discern a tall, unmoving woman there, towering behind them. She is ghostly, as if cut into the silver, and looks on with deep, piercing eyes. A pair of long, spiraling horns extend from her gaunt and mirthless head."
68,"A miniature, silver-plated skull inlaid with black fretwork. The skullcap lifts of on a tiny hinge, revealing holes for three vials, grouped in a triangle, within. Only two vials are there. They are octagonal, ruby red barrels capped with silver."
69,"A bolt of coarse, beige, jute cloth wrapped in a protective oilskin case."
70,"A monocle-like disc upon a fragment of silver chain. Unfit for wear as a monocle, as the thick, yellowed lens is scratched and scuffed with countless minutia and little pitted points. The points seem to coalesce as a man-shaped form. If set before a bright light, the lens projects a diagram: A flayed man, splayed in anatomical position, with labels in an odd language indicating his spilled organs and opened bodily structures."
71,"An old harmonica engraved with a compass card and a variety of fish. When played on land it summons a fresh breeze smelling of salt and seaweed, putting everyone within earshot in a melancholic mood and longing for the sea."
72,"An iron hook, barbed, like those meant for fishing, but quite too large. Two links of rusted, cast iron chain trail from it, followed by a flat, similarly cast tag of iron. It shows, under ample rust, the simple etching of a bony man hung by a hook sunk through his collarbone. Three runes, like circles cut with spurs, are stamped below. The tag has another hole opposite the attachment of its links, suggesting more where attached thereafter."
73,"An ivory comb, the kind meant to lay flat and stay a plate of hair. Blackened, either with age or with purposeful tarnish, and carved on its handle with images of plagued skeletons, obviously undead, spilling over each other in a chilling accurate depiction of frozen, unnaturally insectile movement."
74,"A petrified egg, slightly orange, with one side cut away. A hideous embryo, also fossilized, is curled there. It is a long-backed, anencephalic neonate with long, rodent-like incisors that join to form a sort of beak. It clutches, in three-fingered hands, its own tail. The thing is shot through with long maggots turned by time into red stone."
75,"A silver brooch shaped like an imperious face framed by stylized, curling locks. It has small, yellow garnets for eyes. The eyes seem to be backed by mirrors, for they flash with an unusual brightness while in light. The brooch is magnetic, on its iron back, and connects powerfully to metal objects."
76,"A silver tube, long, worked with branchwork, and thin, filled with yellow powder. Said powder smells of hickory and some astringent tang. It fills the tube, which is closed with a screw cap, to the brim."
77,"A small, ivory figure nailed to a Y-shaped crucifix, also ivory. The figure is carved in excellent detail. Though emaciated and wracked in stiff-limbed agony, a wide and tooth grin is present on the figure's hollow-eyed face."
78,"A small knife, unfit for fighting, with small notches and teeth, like those of a key, cut into its edge. Plainly made from dark, patinated iron. Shiny and sharpened at the hard, toothy edge."
79,"A square bell, rather small, and unusually heavy. Smooth, unrusted, with a short tongue that wags with only great force. It sheds no sound; only heavy vibrations that shake the hand, vibrate one's teeth in their sockets, and touch ringing tones of nearby metal objects."
80,"A squarish iron key, large, with three blocky teeth. One of the teeth rotates, with some difficulty, grinding with rust. The wide, handle portion of the key is also rusted, but depicts, in bas relief, a square door with a howling, heavy-browed face above the keyhole."
81,"A strange pin, like a clothier might use for sewing, but larger, and with a slightly serrated shaft and a red glass bead for a head. Larger than is useful by a factor of two. If stuck in red-blooded flesh, into which it sinks readily, the red bead glows, faintly, flickering like a faint flame in a bloody shade."
82,"A slide whistle made of bone, carved in the shape of an emaciated skeletal figure, mouth agape at the end. When played, it emits an eerie ghostly sounds that can be varied in pitch with the slide."
83,"A thick crystal sphere, large as a grapefruit. Delicate fronds of green flora lie within, all sprouted in a choked abundance from a mess of roots and humus. Yellow dust, perhaps pollen, swirls about the stems amidst motes of white gas. The sphere does not open, and the plants within are like none seen on the earth."
84,"Two glass eyeballs in a tarnished silver box with gold hinges. The orbs lie on dusty, red velvet divots. They are green glass and irregularly shaped in the back. Oddly convoluted inside, like jelly and fish eggs. Gold leaf irises lie under the hard, crystal lenses."
85,"A heady, sweet smelling noose made of still-living flowers and freshly cut vines."
86,"A massive cloth and leather banner emblazoned with the unified crests of ten different fey courts."
87,"A white marble mortar, quite small, chained to its pestle with a thin iron leash. Stained on the interior with blotchy brown. Carved on the outside with simple images of tiny, impish individuals grinding teeth in mortars just large enough to accommodate a molar."
88,"A whale tooth decanter scrimshawed with the image of a gargoyle within a star."
89,"A darkwood and brass door knocker with the image of a rock gnome, and a tower within a teardrop shape. It is of ancient workmanship."
90,"A matching pair of brass bangles, each decorated with the symbol of a sheaf of grain and an oak leaf."
91,"A highly polished shell horn made of walrus tusk."
92,"A beautifully-written madrigal, the first line reading ""Your blazing mass negates any prudence.” in Dwarvish."
93,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of barn, whose interior reveals a farmer milking a cow. The container is filled with dozens of well-preserved strips of beef jerky."
94,"A white handkerchief, slightly yellowed, bordered in black thread. The soft, silky weave sloughs away all soaked or stuck-on mess once fully dried, no matter how dirty. Impossible to tear, by hand, but frayed around the edges. Bears a monogram in one corner; a rune reminiscent of a G, but with more curls."
95,"A short scroll wrapped around a pair of dowels, bearing runic script and celestial patterns painted in rich, bold inks."
96,"A small harp with a body made out of an opaque golden glass that seem to glow as the instrument is played."
97,"A dark black cowl made from a fine matte cloth. The edge of the cowl is lined with a dull silver trim inscribed with shimmering symbols of Thieves Cant."
98,"An ancient set of pipes made from the hollowed out finger bones of a dead bard, whose soul is still bound to them. When music is played from the instrument, listeners can faintly make out a gentle vocal accompaniment that perfectly fits whatever is being played."
99,"A porcelain mask featuring a laughing face and a wide open mouth, and has all manner of colours and inlays on it. Inside the open mouth is just a black void that reflects no light, not even a glossy sheen."
100,"An elven hunting cap that's especially elongated, visually mirroring an elf's elongated, pointed ears. It's black, and the brim is pinned on one side with a tourmaline brooch, holding an iridescent peryton feather."
