1,"Cloak of Angel's Shadow: A beautiful white silk cloak trimmed with downy feathers, freely given by a heavenly angel. The cloak never becomes stained or dirty and always smells clean and fresh. While worn, the bearer's shadow appears to have large, angelic wings and the bearer gains full mental control over their shadow's movements. While worn the bearer gains advantage on all charisma checks (Diplomacy, intimidation, bluff, etc.) made against angels, who recognize the sight and smell of their kin. The bearer suffers disadvantage on all charisma checks made against demons, who recoil at the stench of their ancient foe."
2,"Ring of Rulers: A large signet ring of gold, emblazoned with a unicorn crest of pure white opal. When the band is donned by a commoner, the metal becomes uncomfortably hot but causes no physical injury. A creature of noble blood (However slight), or destined to become a noble at some point in the future, who dons the ring suffers a momentary flash of light and pain which deals a single point of hit point damage. The bearer will find that the unicorn crest has reshaped itself to his own heraldry (Or a heraldry matching the bearer's personality), which has also been branded upon the back of their finger. From then onward, the bearer can don or remove the ring without any further ill effects. If the ring is removed for more than a minute, the signet shifts back into the shape of a unicorn."
3,"A dog sized, domesticated earth elemental that is afraid of beetles but is extraordinarily loyal to whoever employs it. The rocky creatures goes by the name Marl and speaks Common and Terran in the slow, deep rumbling tones of many stones being rubbed together with a specific purpose. Marl considers it's employer to be the last creature to present it with a high quality diamond the size of a large marble and currently sports two such gemstones as “eyes”."
4,"Roll a Random Musical Instrument: A visually beautiful instrument that when played, creates illusory musical notes which dance and flow around the player. The visual quality and movement of the notes depend on the skill of the musician. Fortunately the instrument passes along a basic knowledge of its use to bearer, granting the creature proficiency with it for as long as its held. Still, a naturally poor player with a shoddy or simple song produces small pitiful illusions that mope around, while a master musician playing an orchestral piece creates large vibrant illusionary notes that flow in tune with the melody. ---Note: The instrument: ^RandomMusicalInstruments^"
5,"A thick, heavy belt of woven steel chains, connecting seven different gemstone medallions together. The gems are set (From left to right) diamond, emerald, lapis lazuli, topaz, opal, ruby and amethyst. The belt looks as though it should be worn by a rightful heir."
6,"A wooden box lined with velvet, containing five gems each the same size as the fruit they resemble. A ruby cut in the shape of a strawberry, a faceted emerald in the shape of a lime, an amethyst fashioned in the shape of a plum, a topaz chiseled in the shape of a banana and a diamond sculpted in the shape of a peach."
7,An unbreakable metal cage of meteoric metal with a miniature star contained inside. The celestial body occasionally produces startlingly complex music which coincide with storms that rage across the surface and flare out the bars of the cage. The star emits as much light as a torch and is only slightly warm to the touch.
8,"A brilliant, fist sized gemstone that shine with its own inner light and takes all light that falls upon it and refracts it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow. The wondrously large white gem bears a thousand facets all skillfully cut by dwarven master artisans, lacking a single superfluous edge. The radiance of the precious jewel has no match and shines like silver in firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under the stars and like rain upon the moon."
9,"Connoisseur's Orchestrion: A beautiful hand sized mahogany music box whose working components are made of magically enchanted gold and silver. The object fills its bearer with a sense of musical snobbishness and the desire to listen to, record and play the finest instrumental music possible. When exposed to nonmagical music, the box can be commanded to record the song. The arcane clockwork device can hold up to ten songs and is able to reproduce them in perfect quality, whenever commanded. The music box is an exceptional judge of music and refuses to record music of a lesser quality of what it has already stored. Should the bearer attempt to save an eleventh song, it is compared to the other ten recordings and the objectively worst song is forgotten to make room for the new one. If the eleventh song is worse than the ten already stored the device does not record it or remove a stored song. The bearer has no control over this process which is seen as a blessing among musical circles, as it prevents user error and all but guarantees the music is of masterful quality."
10,"The Devil's Bleeding Crown: A demonic circlet made exclusively of black iron, sporting 13 vicious looking spikes rising from its band. Humanoid faces showing frozen expressions of terror and pain cover the majority of it's exterior. While worn, the faces animate and seem to be screaming in pain and terror although they do not make a single sound. The eye sockets of each face glows with the light of a single burning ember and begin to cry a slow stream of bloody tears onto the bearer. The tears burn like acid (Dealing one point of unpreventable acid or necrotic / unholy /profane damage per round) to good and neutral creatures but is completely harmless to evil bearers and does not effect objects or clothing whatsoever. Knowledgeable PC's will know that the crown is called “Volbeat” and is a demonic royal symbol of the bearer's power, ruthlessness and ability. Finding the crown is fairly simple as the devil who usually wears it never makes an effort to hide or blend in. The crown makes the bearer a target for lower ranking devils to kill him and take the crown, therefore cementing their own place as a prince of devils. This crown is infamous for never being on the same horned head for any length of time. In fact clever devils will sometimes place it on the heads of captured enemies as a torture device, letting the tears burn them slowly until the devil grows bored. Occasionally used to to convert captured enemies to evil by attaching the crown to their heads and placing tests in from of the subjects. For example: “Kill the other helpless prisoner and the burning will end. Your own life matters more than them and stopping the pain means more than their life.” If the subjects commit enough evil acts, their moral alignment changes and the crown will stop burning them."
11,"A suggestively cut, finger lengthed, black diamond that causes erotic dreams when it is placed under a sleeper's head"
12,"A fine tortoiseshell comb that if used to brush a creature's hair for one uninterrupted minute, causes that hair to grow by one inch."
13,"A crystal vial of a rare, high quality perfume that is all but legitimately intoxicating to inhale. The precisely cut vial refills itself each dawn."
14,"A curved horn of dragon bone, inlaid with gold. When blown into, it produces a rich brassy tone that is audible only to those in a five mile radius that the bearer considers allies."
15,"A complete set of noble's attire fit for a king in the modern fashion style. The fabric is mildly enchanted and never dirties, stains, smells unpleasant, and automatically mends itself of all but the most serious wear and tear."
16,"Crown of the Undoubting, Damaged: An ornate golden crown studded with large, clear diamonds and deep blue sapphires. When worn, the gemstones glow and shine with their own inner light, proclaiming the bearer is a true and rightful ruler. A knowledgeable PC will recognize the crown as an ancient method of proving the legitimacy of a person's claim to the thrown, however it's enchantment seems to be failing miserably. Any creature who dons the crown believes themselves to be the rightful ruler of the land they are standing on. While wearing the crown, the bearer cannot be dissuaded from that idea that they are royalty and will not wish to remove the crown under any circumstances. The crown's effect's fade the moment its removed and never cause the drinker to violate any of their strongly held ethics or morals."
17,A heavy gold bracelet with a tiny platinum bell charm that rings out like a large gong when intentionally rung.
18,A gold plated dragonhide pouch with dwarven runes that suggest it once belonged to some great slayer. The gold plating has seen better days and is missing in some places. Inside will be found a series of artistic stones crafted from platinum. It is obvious that the entire collection is not present. When assembled together the stones actually create a rough map which ultimately shows the location of a dwarven tomb. The missing stones will need to be found to complete the map.
19,"A string of large, lustrous pearls long enough to loop around the neck five times over. When worn, the bearer can cause their hair to appear grey or white with age, from peppered with grey and white to a full head of aged hair. If the bearer's hair is already grey or white, they may will it to look like it's natural youthful colour. The change is instantaneous and the illusion is perfect and lasts until the necklace is removed."
20,"A large platinum mug, set with a sparkling star sapphire and enameled in gold. The interior is dark, polished maple."
21,"A life sized rose made of a single nigh-indestructible, crystal clear, multifaceted diamond.."
22,"A large duffel bag containing an impressive collection of ostentatious religious objects made primarily of silver, gold and precious gems that were all stolen from a the largest place of worship (Cathedral, temple, church, etc) of the God of ^RandomGodlyDomains^."
23,"A secure, enameled box, bound with silver cord. Inside is a healthy purple seedling growing a single golden leaf. Extremely knowledgeable PC's can identity the plant as Goldenward, long thought to be extinct. Some records suggest it can be made into a special tonic with protective and life extending properties."
24,"A shallow glazed ceramic bowl that makes all spellcasters who eat or drink directly from it feel feverishly ill and immediately vomit regardless of their physical constitution. The severe nausea lasts for an hour, during which time they are able to take actions and cast spells but are hard pressed to do either."
25,"A silver ewer that fills itself with wine of exquisite quality every dawn. The wine evaporates if not consumed by dusk. If the empty ewer is placed within five feet of a selection of foodstuffs, the created alcohol will act as the perfect wine pairing to the meal."
26,"A large, heavy bar of orichalcum, a reddish-gold metal only mentioned in ancient literature as the process for making it has been lost to memory. It is rumored to have extraordinary properties when incorporated into weapons and armor."
27,"A foot-tall platinum sculpture of thin, elaborately bent cylindrical twists that form the shape of a stylized egg. At the center rests a multifaceted golden topaz."
28,"A platinum pendant worked into the shape of a pixie, dotted with emeralds and mother of pearl, strung on a braided cord of silver wire."
29,"An steel-bound oaken chest lined with velvet, containing a dozen, delicate porcelain plates. They are all inlaid with gold and each one is magnificently decorated with a different zodiac symbol. The 12 animals were applied just before the baking process with a specialized paint consisting of mainly of powered gemstones, with each symbol using only one of type of precious jewel."
30,"A bundle of good quality, feathery griffon pelts tied together with silk and wrapped in a protective oilskin case."
31,"An ornamental rapier with a blunted silver blade, gold filigree on the guard and an electrum pommel. A collection of precious jewels are set into the hilt and it is clear that the object was built to been seen not used, as the “weapon” is neither designed nor weighted for combat."
32,"Chalice of Uncomfortably Tempered Liquid: An ornate golden chalice encrusted with gemstones. No matter what liquid is in the cup, it will seem to be at a temperature that is unpleasant to drink (Either warmer or colder, whichever is subjectively worse for the drinker) . The cup does not actually change the temperature of the liquid, it simply changes the drinker's perception of the liquid's temperature. This gaudy object was no doubt some sort of aristocratic prank or test of character for nobles."
33,"Elven Earrings: A pair of delicate leaf shaped earrings made of silver, delicately harvested without disturbing the natural world. When worn, the bearer's ears become narrow and pointed like those of an elf and facial features become slender and graceful. Any onlooker paying attention would swear that the bearer can traces of elven blood in his veins. This is an instantaneous, painless physical change (Not illusionary and thus can be felt) which reverses itself the moment the earrings are removed."
34,"A dog sized, domesticated water elemental that is afraid of eels but is extraordinarily loyal to whoever employs it. The flowing creature goes by the name Brook and speaks Common and Aquan in the babbling rush of a waterfall, with words continually torrenting out of the general shape of its face. Brook considers it's employer to be the last creature to present it with a gallon of pure ice harvested from one of the polar caps. The elemental takes the ice into itself which melts, incorporating the rare liquid throughout its body."
35,"A silver cup inlaid with ivory and covered with elvish script that sings mesmerizing elvish chants with the full tone, harmony and range of a full choir when filled with wine but howls in tortured anguish when filled with anything else."
36,"A delicate porcelain cup that instantly cools any liquid of any sort (From hot tea to hotter lava) placed in it to 40 F (4.4C). The cup itself remains at room temperature and is never harmed by heat, hot liquids or temperature changes of any kind for any reason."
37,"A platinum tuning fork that when struck, produces the single most satisfying note anyone has ever heard. It can be rung as often as desired and can quickly become addicting to listen to."
38,"A beautifully decorated crystal vase that magically preserves any flowers placed in it while still allowing this fresh scent to fill the air. As long as the flowers stay in the vase that remain in full bloom and free of any wilt despite a complete lack of light, fertilizer, air, proper temperature or water. Although many vases are magically enchanted to have similar properties, this one is unique in that the blooming flowers remain fertile and produce pollen as if they were in their prime. These vases are usually owned by serious horticulturists who use them to keep dozens of different species of delicate flowers alive, healthy and continually providing genetic material for pure and crossbreeding."
39,"A one foot tall, platinum figurine of a regal dragon striking a dramatic pose with its head upright, claws firmly planted and its wings fully spread."
40,"Harp of the Pure: A one handed, triangular shaped harp, made of willow wood and strung with silver strings. If a good hearted creature sings while playing the harp outdoors, cute harmless creatures in the nearby area such as squirrels, songbirds and rabbits will approach the bearer. The animals cavort around the bearer and dance to the clear sounds of the silver strings for as long as the bearer continues to sing and play music. Intelligent animals and humanoids find the music soothing and it fills them with energy and a willingness to dance, sing and make merry. The harmless animals will continue to frolic until any creature in the area shows signs of open hostility or violence, at which point they scatter and resume normal behaviors for their species. The harp can be played as much as desired but never functions for a user who played the harp in order draw creatures in to be harmed or who harmed a defenseless creature while the harp was being played."
41,"Cloak of Demon's Shadow: A sinister black leather cloak trimmed with coarse red fur, unwillingly taken from an unholy demon. The cloak never becomes stained or dirty and always smells faintly of brimstone. While worn, the bearer's shadow appears to have large demonic bat wings and the bearer gains full mental control over their shadow's movements. While worn the bearer gains advantage on all charisma checks (Diplomacy, intimidation, bluff, etc.) made against demons, who recognize the sight and smell of their kin. The bearer suffers disadvantage on all charisma checks made against angels, who recoil at the stench of their ancient foe."
42,"Song of the Ocean: A fist sized elaborately scrimshawed piece of whale skull, carved in the shape of a humpback whale. When both are completely submerged in water, the bearer can telepathically communicate with whales in the same ocean or sea as himself."
43,Courtesan's Little Helper: A pair of delicate silver tweezers with diamond studs that would not amiss in a noblewoman's purse. Any hair follicles plucked by these tweezers do not begin to regrow until a year and a day has passed. The hairs must be plucked individually for the magic to take effect but there is no limit on the amount of hair that can be plucked.
44,"A drinking horn fashioned from a pristine unicorn horn with a shoulder strap made from braided hair from the unicorn's mane. Any liquid drank straight from the horn tastes pure and sweet and the drinker gains advantage on any checks to resist poisons, toxins or disease the liquid may contain. However, the drinker becomes wracked with shame and guilt, feeling that he has spoiled something wonderful."
45,"An elegant puppet theater one cubic foot in size,containing magically animated dolls. Although its wood is brightly polished and the red of its satin curtains is bright and fresh, the hand-painted sign upon its front (Reading “The Wondrous Shows of Punch and Judy” in carnival lettering) is chipped and faded. If the curtains are opened (Using a set of finely woven pulley ropes which lie inside the theater), the puppets (Stored in a concealed compartment “backstage”) will come to life and perform elaborate shows of their own volition. The puppets can speak and interact with the audience to a limited extent for entertainment purposes and the theater creates lively background music. The puppets can remain animate indefinitely and will continuously create new stories, plots and jokes for as long as it remains active."
46,"A silk pouch containing a dozen, oval shaped, platinum coins, displaying a dragon on one side and a shield on the other. The stamping reveals the coins were minted in the draconic tongue."
47,"A beautiful pair of indestructible glass high heeled slippers that change size based on who's trying them on. Creatures without any form of noble blood themselves or who are not related to nobility in any way, find that the high heels fit perfectly and are very comfortable. Creatures who are of any noble standing or are related to nobility in any way find that the high heels are far too small and that they cannot put them on. Desperate enough nobles do find that if they cut off their big toe, the high heels will fit their feet."
48,"A golden disk inset with nine small gems (diamond, emerald, sapphire, ruby, onyx, pearl, moonstone, jacinth, and jet) arranged in a spiral pattern. When worn by a creature capable of casting magical spells, the jewels glow with their own inner light. Disks such as this are used in the Mage's Guild to identify the bearer as ranking of the arcane order."
49,A court seal composed of silver and carved lapis lazuli that bears the personal mark of the king. Knowledgeable PC's can identity the seal as genuine and realize that there would be an official and fair reward for returning it to the king's court. Alternatively a significant profit could be made selling it to any number of criminal organizations.
50,"A miniature golden chest with tiny emeralds lining the top that trace out a mage's sigil. The chest is crafted in exquisite detail and radiates powerful conjuration magic. Spell casters may recognize it for the material component of the spell “Secret Chest” and the mage's sigil is that of the ruthless mage Aumurille, who will likely want her property back…."
51,"A roughly beaten solid gold orb, roughly ten inches in diameter, etched with the likeness of an orcish skull with an axe embedded in it. Knowledgeable PC's can determine that is was used by an orcish chieftain as her royal orb."
52,"A five-gallon cask of blessed silver nails, each etched with the holy symbol of the God of ^GoodDomains^ and all completely submerged in holy oil."
53,"A strange abacus made of ebony with counting beads made of ivory, silver, gold, and vitrified humanoid eyeballs."
54,A set of stamps and hammers designed for minting the local coinage. Knowledgeable PC's can determine that they are not forgers reproductions but genuine minting tools. These would fetch a fair reward for returning them to the proper authorities or a sizable monetary compensation if sold to forgers and black marketeers.
55,"A finely crafted compass of gold and silver, stamped with ornate dwarven runes. The compass functions perfectly while underground, near large sources of metal and while while interacting with other magnetic or magical fields."
56,"A hand sized statuette of a dragon forged from the finest, purest mithril, which responds cryptically to yes or no questions which are posed to it in draconic. The answers given may appear prophetic or oracular, but are actually completely random."
57,"A travel sized Clàrsach harp in the style of the northern barbarians, but crafted with an elegance which suggests the decadence of a great civilization. Its strings are almost too fine to be perceived with the naked eye and when played, they resonate with the force of a full orchestra."
58,"A thumb sized diamond of incredible beauty which slowly shifts its color from the purest clear white to yellow to blue to black and back again. A bearer can choose the halt or continue the colour transition with a thought, allowing for a jewel whose hue can match an entire wardrobe. The gem begins its colour shifting rotation when it's removed."
59,"A bundle of good quality, fluffy pegasus pelts tied together with silk and wrapped in a protective oilskin case."
60,"A loop of chain made to be worn as a form of necklace, with each large link made of a different type of metal. There is one link of each of the following metals: gold, silver, iron, black iron, lead, copper, bronze, steel, electrum, brass, pewter, platinum and tin. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as a symbol of membership and status of an ancient order known as the Maesters. They were an order of scholars, healers, postmen, and scientists who were trained at a school called the Citadel. Sometimes called “the knights of the mind”, Maesters often served as advisers in matters of warfare. Each different metal stands for a different area of expertise and knowledge, meaning this chain came from a Maester who had experience in nearly all of their disciplines. Very few, if any of their order remains and their existence itself is sometimes debated as legend rather than fact."
61,A large golden chalice encrusted with jewels and writings from a forgotten language. At a casual glance the symbols appear to suggest that the cup was used during sacrifices and could be a key element in a divine ritual.
62,"A small, magically preserved painting of a well-known historical figure. The painting was stolen by raiders during a large war and lost until now. Not only is the figure in the painting famous but it was also created by a renowned artist from that era. This genuine artifact has both extreme historical significance as well as monetary value to the right buyer."
63,"A dog sized, domesticated air elemental that is afraid of bats but is extraordinarily loyal to whoever employs it. The insubstantial creature goes by the name Gale and speaks Common and Auran in breathy, whispering words that seem to have been carried in on the breeze. Gale considers it's employer to be the last creature to present it with a pair of feathers from an extinct species of flying creature and currently sports an example of such of plumage as “eyes”."
64,"A rich maple travel case lined with purple velvet that contains a dozen opulent war darts. Each lavish missiles is comprised of a single razor sharp point cut diamond in a platinum setting which then thins into a loose spiral around the dart's black ebony wood core, that's been impeccably fletched with peacock feathers. The weapon's obscenely expensive materials combined with their masterful craftsmanship results in a collection of darts that may be used to kill, but are unlikely to be the murder weapon. Their value is such that it would be far more efficient for the wielder to simply offer one as payment to a reasonably priced assassin rather than stooping to actually throw it at a target."
65,"A small, compact mirror made of platinum. The outside is embellished in a sketching of a beautiful woman inlaid with fine strips of gold. Once opened, the viewer sees themselves as they have always wanted to appear. It changes nothing of their actual visual appearance, but their reflected image is of how they've always wanted to be seen."
66,"An ornate hair net fashioned from silk and gold wire, interwoven with numerous precious jewels. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this piece as part of the family jewels of an old and influential noble family, who would no doubt pay handsomely for the return of a family heirloom."
67,"An ornate, crystal hourglass set in a heavy golden frame with silver filigree running up and down the sides. Within, in lieu of sand, the crystal is filled with ruby fragments, ground to a fine powder to keep track of the hour. The crystal vibrates and tinkles as the powdered gemstone slides down it, making an almost musical song while the time passes."
68,A whalebone corset embellished with prominent gold treading and set with a dozen sparkling sapphires along the top of the bosom. The golden embroidery flows in a gorgeous filigree pattern. The wide silk laces in the back are a deep blue to match the sapphires on the front.
69,"Gloves of the Lady: A pair of ladies black, silken evening gloves that were worn by a royal snob for the majority of her social outings. While worn, the bearer becomes an expert in etiquette and gains an uncanny knack for upper class social queues and manners. The bearer gains advantage on all knowledge checks related to high class etiquette, court manners, codes of royal social behavior and upper class social norms and gains advantage on all diplomacy checks made to interact with members of high society, royalty or nobility in a formal setting. However the gloves also impart the arrogant, snobby and downright condescending way of holding oneself and tone of voice that creates resentment in those of the lower classes. The bearer suffers disadvantage on all charisma based checks (Diplomacy, intimidation, bluff, etc) towards creatures that are not nobility, royalty or general high society. This penalty includes servants, guards, maids, butlers and footmen who serve nobles and interact with them regularly but who are not nobles themselves. The gloves must be worn for one hour before the bearer gains the benefits, however the penalty to charisma checks takes effect immediately when worn."
70,"A lightweight feather quill crafted entirely out of platinum. The hundreds of delicate bards were each expertly crafted to look like nothing other than a natural, organic feather. The quill's tip is masterfully carved ivory and on the other end is a perfectly painted, bright green cat eye."
71,"An ewer consisting of dozens of interlocked pieces of ivory that fit together like a puzzle, with gold along the seams acting as a lavish glue. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize it as the centerpiece of an ancient ritual by a high priestess to appease a long since forgotten Demigod of an old, and powerful river. The minor deity has not been prayed to using the ewer in centuries and would no doubt greatly appreciate a creature who completed the ritual."
72,"Animated Shaving Razor: A wickedly sharp, silver straight razor that trembles in anticipation when held close to uncut hair. A creature holding the razor can let it go while giving it an order to “Shave X” after which it whips though the air like a whirlwind of swishing fury and gleaming metal, cutting away all the bearer's designated hair in a matter of seconds leaving behind smooth moisturized skin without harming the affected creature in the least. More precise instructions can be given to have the razor style hair into patterns or shapes. The blade refuses to draw blood under any circumstance and cannot be used as a weapon. The bearer can only use the razor to shave themselves, the blade ignores instructions to shave other creatures or objects."
73,"A dog sized, domesticated fire elemental that is afraid of salamanders but is extraordinarily loyal to whoever employs it. The blazing creature goes by the name Ash and speaks Common and Ignan in the hoarse rasping of a lifelong smoker, whose dry words are undercut by constant crackling noises. Ash considers it's employer to be the last creature to present it with ten pounds of powdered magnesium and stands far back. The elemental immediately takes the metal into itself and burns it in a brilliant explosion of fiery white light. This process never harms Ash who compares the sensation to humanoids when they eat extremely spicy food."
74,"A globe shaped pendant of clear crystal that hangs from a thick platinum chain. When held up the light of a half moon, the crystal will takes on the appearance of a watchful icy blue and silver eye."
75,"A heavy scepter with an hourglass-shaped goblet affixed atop it, made entirely of gold. The scepter can be separated into two pieces; a golden rod as long as a man's forearm, splaying out into a disc shape just below the end, and a golden cup that can be locked into place by sliding it down the rod."
76,"A detailed, regular sized arrow made entirely of gold, including it's head and fletching. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as the first place trophy of the annual archery competition of the largest metropolis of the land."
77,A seamlessly shaped pocket watch made of platinum and gold with what looks to be copper running in branching veins along and under the surface of the case. The dial (face) is protected by a hinged cover that's decorated with the nearest other planet and an hourglass delicately etched into the precious metals. The interior is a stunning array of gears and hands and notches and springs that seem to move in relationships that grow infinitely more complex the longer one watches them. The watch always tells perfect time and has no need of winding or maintenance.
78,"Ascot of the Gentleman: A black, silken ascot that was worn by a royal snob for the majority of his social outings. While worn, the bearer becomes an expert in etiquette and gains an uncanny knack for upper class social queues and manners. The bearer gains advantage on all knowledge checks related to high class etiquette, court manners, codes of royal social behavior and upper class social norms and gains advantage on all diplomacy checks made to interact with members of high society, royalty or nobility in a formal setting. However the ascot also imparts the arrogant, snobby and downright condescending way of holding oneself and tone of voice that creates resentment in those of the lower classes. The bearer suffers disadvantage on all charisma based checks (Diplomacy, intimidation, bluff, etc) towards creatures that are not nobility, royalty or general high society. This penalty includes servants, guards, maids, butlers and footmen who serve nobles and interact with them regularly but who are not nobles themselves. The ascot must be worn for one hour before the bearer gains the benefits, however the penalty to charisma checks takes effect immediately when worn."
79,"A bundle of good quality, luxurious unicorn pelts tied together with silk and wrapped in a protective oilskin case."
80,A circular gold medallion strung on a thick purple ribbon. The medal is plain except for a set of five interlocking circles underneath the word “1st” which has all been etched into the gold. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize this as the first place trophy of multiplanar sporting event that occurs every four years.
81,"Morning Bell: A platinum handbell that when rung, allows the bearer to magically clean themselves. When rung, the bearer and the set of clothing that they are wearing are instantly cleaned and freshened. Stains are washed away, dirt is brushed off and falls to the ground, exposed metal is buffed and polished, the user's hair and skin are cleaned, their nails are clipped and their teeth brushed. Any bad scents are completely dispersed and replaced with a faint aroma of the bearer choosing. The bell functions twice per day. Though there is no actual restriction on when the bell is used, its name comes from the common usage; to assist a person (Typically a wealthy couple) in freshening up in the morning to they can meet the day neat and clean."
82,A razor sharp ceremonial dagger bearing an electrum blade a large black pearl set in the pommel
83,"A single platinum bracer etched with a large symbol of an open eye. The armband is set with a hollow, disk shaped sapphire that forms the iris and a deep black opal that creates a pupil that seems to drink in light."
84,A finely carved cherry wood travel case containing a jade chess board with solid gold playing pieces
85,A beautiful life sized ice sculpture of a graceful swam that never melts or becomes damaged.
86,"A gracefully shaped, one foot tall statuette of a genie formed of clear crystal. Its hands are posed holding a diamond orb above its head."
87,"A one foot tall, highly polished silver statuette of an adorable blue dragon hatchling that is posed resting in the cracked remains of a shell of pure sapphire."
88,A small hand mirror made from polished platinum with a handle made of a demon's horn. The reflective surface reflects only the ill intent and evil nature of any creature that holds it.
89,"A gold and enamel brooch in the shape of a swan. The jewel is formed as a standing mute swan “gorged” with a gold collar in the form of a royal crown with six fleur-de-lys tines. There is a gold chain terminating in a ring attached to the crown, and the swan has a pin and catch on its right side for fastening the brooch to clothes or a hat. The swan is just over one inch tall and two inches wide, with a three inch chain. The swan's body is in white enamel, its eyes are of black enamel, and the beak is decorated in red enamel. Knowledgeable PC's will recognize it as a livery badge, a sign of association and loyalty to a rich noble house."
90,"A pink porcelain brooch with platinum inlay with the image of a smiling and handsome (But portly) bald cleric in sackcloth looking up into a sun with beams of light cast down upon him, his hands clasped together before him in prayer.

92,"A lavish, palm sized brooch made of gold and lapis lazuli, fashioned in the shape of a scarab beetle."
93,"A silk pouch containing a dozen, square shaped, electrum coins, displaying a skull on one side and a staff on the other. The stamping reveals the coins were minted in the elvish tongue."
94,"A goose egg made of pure, solid gold. The metal lacks any sort of tool or craft marks and looks like it was laid rather than forged."
95,"A exquisitely made, life sized, half a pomegranate made of pure silver with luscious garnet seeds that rests on a small onyx stand."
96,"A heavy mask made of finely hammered gold, that covers the bearer's face from the chin to the top of the forehead. The mask's expression shifts between three different states: solemn, fierce, and mournful, in order to match its bearer's mood."
97,"A soft, silk scarf that has been enchanted to look like pure flowing water. The water ripples and flows like a clear stream, its current traveling in a single direction in relation to the scarf. The bearer can concentrate on the scarf to alter the illusion slightly, changing the direction of the current or to increase or decrease the amount of eddies and ripples in the water's flow. The scarf never dirties and resists most forms of damage."
98,A collapsible telescope made of gold and crystal. The adjustable scope allows the bearer to increase magnification from ten times to 100 times normal sight.
99,"A sturdy iron banded wooden travel case. Inside the case are two cushions, a layer of velvet, and several silk straps all meant to secure and protect a single object; a small unlabeled vial made of thick hardened glass with a stopper that's been covered in several layers of sealing wax. Inside the vial floats the blood and small chunks of brain matter harvested from a living Elder Brain of a Mind Flayer city. The vial has a preserving enchantment on it that keeps the blood and brain matter as fresh as if it was still alive. To say that this is a rare material would be to say that the sun is warm and only extremely knowledgeable PC's would be able to identify it properly. Selling this object should theoretically be simple, as anyone familiar with the contents would covet the brain matter for their own personal gain and would buy it from the bearer. Selling the vial for the value of what it is actually worth will be next to impossible given its sheer rarity."
100,"Wizard's Chess: An ornate marble chess set, bearing incredibly detailed humanoid pieces which rest on a checkerboard of deepest black and purest white. The underside of each piece as well as the board itself bears arcane runes of transmutation, illusion and memory. At a passing glance it is obvious that entire set has been enchanted with several magical effects. The board can understand verbal commands which allows the players to order their pieces to move remotely, negating the need to physically interact with the board at all. The board contains a measure of intelligence, strategies and movesets, allowing a single creature to play full games against the board itself. The creature can choose from a “simple” “moderate” or “challenging” difficulty setting which dictates the board's level of skill. A creature can also set the board to have no players and simply watch the set play against itself and to begin a new game as soon as checkmate is reached, creating an endless loop of play. An individual chess piece that strays farther than ten feet from the set, instantly teleports back to its proper place on the board. Finally, the set can be commanded to pack itself up which causes the pieces to fold up the board along invisible seams collapsing the entire board into a fist sized marble cube that weighs one pound. The most obvious enchantments lie with the carved figurine pieces. While they remain within three feet of the board, the masterfully detailed pieces take on lifelike qualities. The stony faces of the pawns tighten into expressions ranging from nervousness and clueless bravado to outright terror as they fiddle with their makeshift weapons adapted from simple farming tools. Horses paw at the ground while their knights ready their maces and shields. Bishops raise hands and staffs to the sky as their mouths move to speak prayers of victory and hymns of battle, while miniature bowmen can be seen peeking from the rook's archer slits. The kings and queens being the largest pieces have the most noticeable details and are perhaps the most impressive. The queens stand tall with a regal bearing, wearing well-fitting armor that is as functional and it is beautiful. Their thin tiaras hold back their shoulder length hair that blows dramatically in the wind but never obscures their faces. They each bear a single weapon, a heavy royal scepter, beautiful and deadly, which they wield in both hands. The kings on the other hand are haggard and stooped over as if weighed down by their garishly oversized crowns and heavy fur cloaks that trails on the ground. They wear foppish court clothes lacking any trace of actual protection and each hold (It would be too generous to call the action “wielding”) a small overly jeweled dagger with a sense of frantic paranoia in their marble eyes. When a piece would normally take another piece, the two figurines play out a few moments of a choreographed duel which ends in bloodshed and the death of the taken piece, which then moves itself to the side of the board."
