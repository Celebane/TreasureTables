1,"A long scroll containing a complex table of positions of various stellar bodies at different times, along with a number of diagrams."
2,"A black-and-gray thurible decorated with a skeleton motif. The jaw of one of the decorative skulls unhinges, allowing the bearer to quickly load it with incense. A long, thin chain is connected to the top of the thurible, allowing it to be held and swung."
3,"A pewter cloak clasp shaped like a chuul. The beast's claws hold the cloak closed."
4,"A bag of jacks, an evolution of the scatter sticks game, jacks are twisted pieces of metal vaguely resembling caltrops. It comes in a set of twenty with a single reasonably elastic ball. The goal is to bounce the ball, collect as many jacks as possible, and catch the ball before it hits the ground. While the simple game is predominately played by children it can often be found in taverns as the addition of alcohol can greatly increase the difficulty."
5,"A bandolier with three thick glass flasks slosh thickly with a heavy black fluid. An acrid stench greets anyone who opens one of these. Each flask contains a powerful acid."
6,"A battered old music box. It plays an eerie tune which, if listened to continuously for more than a minute, produces intense feelings of nausea and induces vomiting."
7,"A beautiful harp of white wood with elven runes carved along its length. The markings upon the harp speak of love, peace and tranquility. The instrument is constructed from the heart wood of an ancient elm. The harp's strings are of finely braided blonde elven hair."
8,"A beautiful whistle carved from a single piece of white oak with a detailed motif of antlers, laurel leaves, mistletoe and acorns. The object seems especially vibrant when in the vicinity of a forest. The deeper into the woodlands it is, the more distinct its color and patterning appears."
9,"A beige linen sack contains six pounds of cloves. A black stylized rose is drawn on the sack's center."
10,"A coconut-sized glass sphere that appears to contain a swirling hurricane within. The surface of the orb is etched with signs and symbols used in detailed descriptions of the weather. This orb matches the description of an artifact exiled from a distant empire six centuries ago."
11,"A belt pouch containing 2d8+2 pieces of rawhide. Laced with spices, canines find these strips of sun-dried meat particularly tasty. A PC offers one of the pieces to a dog gains a +1 on their Handle Animal skill check to interact with it for the next 30 seconds."
12,"A blue robe of a college graduate with a tag on the inside that reads “To my dearest pupil, and a woman I deeply respect”."

14,"A carved boxwood sliding-top box containing a small polished opal,"
15,"A ceramic jar labeled “Traveler's Stock” containing an almost black paste made of the highly concentrated renderings of various animals and grains. The stock can make an excellent and hearty soup assuming that you can get a fire going and have clean water to boil it in. The jar contains enough material to make ##3d4+3## day's rations worth of soup and the stock will not spoil for ##3d4## months as long as the jar is kept tightly sealed when not in use."
16,"A cherrywood bowl depicting elven dancers and satyr musicians and filled with dried yellow mushrooms."
17,"A cleaned human skull encased in a large glass cube."
18,"A cleverly designed ^RandomColourTable^, shirt deceptively made of a single piece of strong, flat, silk cord. It is stitched together in such a way that a tug in the right place unravels it into a 30-foot length of strong silk rope. Fully unraveling the cord shirt requires an action equivalent to attacking and two free hands. A PC proficient in tailoring can re-stich it into a shirt with a few hours of effort and a tailor's kit."

21,"A dark blue plush carpet featuring a segment of night sky, complete with constellations in silver thread."
22,"A crookneck lantern consisting of a leather-wrapped metal tube with a shorter glass-covered metal tube at one end. Small mirrors inside the lantern reflect and intensify the light shed by the candle held within the main body. Shrouded air holes line the top and bottom of both tubes. The crookneck lantern also has a weight at the bottom of the main tube so it can be set down and not fall over. A single candle burning within the lantern will illuminate a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line and provides shadowy illumination in a 100-foot cone (with the illuminating line in the center of the cone). A single candle burns for 1 hour."
23,"A delicate, almost translucent, greenish-white jade bowl."
24,"A crude map of the local area inscribed on a tattered canvas scroll, that bears an “X” marking an area near where the map was found. There is a list of instructions in the bottom corner of the map: Find the skeleton of a small dragon, then go south 2-3 miles, until you find the waterfall. From there, go east 1-2 miles until you find the ruined mage's tower, then go north-east for 3-4 miles and you'll find the cache hidden at the bottom of an old rabbit's warren. —Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end. The map could easily be a prank, trap, confidence scheme, ambush or the area could already have been stripped of any value by other adventurers."

26,"A dire walrus tusk, three foot long, decorated with scrimshaw carving of a dragonship."

30,"A dwarven drinking horn bearing the symbol of the Runewise clan."
31,"A grocery list which, halfway through, clearly becomes a list of ingredients for an occult ritual as it starts listing objects such as the blood of a murderer's child, candles made from minotaur tallow, the tongue of a second-rate poet, a serrated knife, one set black robes, incense, an altar-stone quarried from Mount Shudder, salt distilled from virgin's tears, etcetera."
32,"A fine wooden lute inlaid with mother of pearl, bearing the maker's mark of the celebrated Philomenos Trugg."

34,"A full length robe of night-blue silk"
35,"A full-face mask covered in hard black obsidian glass that is completely transparent looking out, but completely opaque looking in."
36,"A glass and silver hookah, decorated with a serpentine dragon motif."
37,"A glass egg with dark bands of grey that looks like smoke. It is barely half the size of a chicken egg and it catches bright light in off ways. Around firelight, it almost seems to glow."

42,"A heavy case lined with numerous straps and cushions that can be used to safely transport delicate objects from one location to another. While the case seemed to have been designed specifically for holy relics, any other item placed within will be safe from breakage unless the case itself is destroyed. The wide variety of buckles and different cushion sizes allows any item of up to three feet in length and two feet in width to be secured within."
43,"A large platter with four stubby, clawed feet and an ornate, raised, spiral pattern on its surface. Despite being twenty-four inches in diameter, the thick platter and its feet are made of a single piece of seemingly uncarved bone. Upon command, the top of the platter opens like a flower, revealing a thin, blood-filled basin which can be used as crystal ball."
44,"A large tin canister whose lid is stamped with the image of a well-stocked confectionary shop bustling with children. The container is filled with dozens of red and white striped peppermint candies."
45,"A large, cracked, spiral horn of some great beast, bound in silver and caked in blood. When blown, hot winds and swirling sands erupt from the mouth. All who hear the horn's call fight with the fury of the nine hells."

48,"A lovely pair of dangling earrings made of enameled disks featuring wreaths of green leaves and purple berries."
49,"A one gallon cask of an alcoholic beverage known as Earth's Blood. This thick, reddish concoction of wine and herbs is extremely popular with explorers who find themselves traveling through the higher mountains of the world. If imbued it enriches the blood of most races (Dwarves for some reason are not affected), allowing them not to be fatigued because of the cold or low oxygen conditions. The cask contains enough for ##3d4+2## creatures to drink enough to benefit from it. Each dose lasts for twelve hours."

66,"A sealed lead box the size of a man's fist. It contains strips of parchment bearing magical phrases and sigils written in silver and blood. A bearer knowledgeable in arcane matters can identify the markings as dark magic spells of naming, binding and immortality. An extremely knowledgeable PC is able to determine that this could be a lich's phylactery but is not able to determine if it is incomplete or one that was used but was a complete failure."
67,"A section of feathered wicker bound with cord around a short, wooden handle. Known as an erasing broom, in the handle of a survivalist is can be used to obscure one's trail making it difficult for the bearer to be tracked on foot."

76,"A small marble that glints with astonishing luster when exposed to bright light."
77,"A small pine trunk with a brass carrying handle on its lid. Inside is a disguise kit containing clumps of thick prosthetic paste, tins of make-up, twined bundles of hair, and other tools of an actor's (or spy's) trade are carefully arranged inside the small drawers and trays."

79,"A sterling silver snuffbox with a mirrored surface that's edged in detailed ornamental scrollwork."

81,"A superstitious charm made of a rat tail that is particularly filthy and smells faintly of vomit. The tail is stiff, like a wire, and it can be bent into different shapes. It would almost make a great lockpick, except it is too thick."
82,"A tapestry showing a great battle between mounted knights of Kjarran and ravening orc hordes."
83,"A thumb sized polished red stone. Just beneath the stone's smooth surface runs a labyrinth of small cracks and fractures. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as jasper."

88,"A wooden box containing a dozen candles made of ^RandomColourTable^ wax. When lit the candles produce a thick, persistent smoke the same color as the wax. The smoke creates a haze similar to good pipe smoke and is not acrid or foul tasting. Each candle will burn for one hour."
89,"A wooden chandelier with bronze dragon-headed candle holders."
90,"A wooden training sword covered in bells and red and black swatches of fabric. It would be more suited to a jester than a soldier in training."
91,"An egg-sized orb of compressed powder that PC's knowledgeable in alchemy or the performance arts will recognize as a Flash Bomb. Originally developed by alchemists as a showpiece for entertainers, this one was made by rogues of the local thieves' guild and when it is thrown into a fire it flashes into the shape of a skull that is10-feet-tall and 20-feet wide. The flash of white light lasts only an instant but leaves a bright skull-shaped spot in the vision of all who view it. Creatures within 20 feet of the flash's center suffer disadvantage on visual perception checks and ranged attacks for 1d4 rounds. The orb can be fired from a sling as easily as one might launch a bullet or can be thrown accurately into a five foot area within 30 feet. Knowledgeable PC's know that the thieves' guild uses these bombs as a sort of warning and calling card. A civilian who witnesses a crime occur but sees the skull appear would immediately walk away and never dream of seeking out the authorities or telling a guard a single detail of what happened."
92,"An oil painting of an old farmer in a barn sharpening a knife while looking down at a docile white lamb. In the background a small girl peers through a window."
93,"An egg-shaped, polished stone that seems just a touch too small to perfectly fit in one's palm. It draws the gaze inward, as if peering into a well of impenetrable black shadows, where the deeper one looks the deeper the darkness gets. Knowledgeable PC's can identify the mineral as onyx."

98,"An opaque sphere that feels like glass, but is warm to the touch. Within the sphere is an ever swirling vortex of red and black mist, where odd shapes form and flicker momentarily before vanishing once again. The orb varies in diameter from one inch to two feet, usually at the bearer's will, but occasionally appears to alter of its own accord. This random alteration of size only occurs if left unattended (Such as in a pack or pouch, or if the bearer sleeps). The bearer's sleep is disturbed by dark but prophetic dreams."
99,"An ornate reliquary of cedar overlaid with ivory and ebony marquetry. Inside, on an undyed velvet cushion, is a skeletal finger tipped with a long curved claw."
100,"Vindictive Tankard: A thick, dented tin tankard etched on one side with a sneering, apathetic judgmental face. When filled with ale, cider or wine and held up meaningfully, the face will animate for a few seconds and grievously insult the humanoid which it is most directly facing, seeming to have an uncanny knack for genuinely annoying even the thickest-skinned of subjects. If there are no humanoids in view, the tankard insults the owner for wasting its time."
