2,"A ^RandomNon-AmmunitionWeapons^ with the image of a ^RandomMusicalInstruments^ painted on the grip. Whenever the wielder scores a critical hit with the weapon, it emits a resounding, triumphant fanfare as if the musical instrument on the grip was expertly played for dramatic effect. Similarly whenever the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll, the weapon emits a sorrowful musical flourish that lingers for a few moments."
3,"A longspear with a knapped flint blade. The words “The answer to the sphinx's riddle is a castle” have been hastily scratched into the haft."
4,"A huge greataxe with a crescent-moon shaped blade that's specifically designed for hamstringing elephants, though it is capable of delivering devastating wounds against any sort of foe.

17,"A longbow which a certain contradiction at work in its construction. Its handle and limbs are fashioned from pristine white dragon bone and scales, banded in silver and ivory.

18,"An inconspicuous quiver containing ##5d6## blowgun darts whose bamboo shafts have been hollowed and waxed, allowing them to contain two doses of poison or suitable alchemical substances without ever drying out or becoming inert.

34,"An ebony sword cane that would not look out of place in an aristocrat's hand. One end is shaped like the head of a black cat and can be pulled out to reveal a needle-like blade. The cane is not immediately recognizable as a concealed weapon and observers suffer disadvantage on identifying it as such, while the bearer gains advantage on all checks relating to concealing its true nature.
