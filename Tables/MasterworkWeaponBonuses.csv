1,"Precise: The weapon's grip has been modified to amplify every tiny movement of the wielder's hands, allowing it to respond even the smallest flick of the wrist. The weapon's precise movements allow the wielder to execute accurate strikes, granting a +1 on attack rolls to hit targets. —Note: Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition when fired."
2,"Balanced: The weight of the object is expertly distributed over its length with a focus on additional weight on the business end of the weapon. This allows the wielder to utilize their own weight as a counterbalance and their arms as a fulcrum, allowing each strike to hit harder. Ammunition with this bonus has been carefully crafted in regard to its weight ratio in order to channel the weapon's force into the correct angle of release to better strike the target. In ranged weapons this bonus represents stronger limbs and strings, allowing a greater storage of kinetic force that is then released into the ammunition. The weapon grants an additional +1 to all damage rolls made with it. —Note: Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
3,"Spellbound: This weapon tingles faintly with magical energy, barely detectable to those who aren't specifically looking for it. The weapon could bear simple arcane runes along it's length, spent years of time directly exposed to magical energy thereby soaking it in, was blessed by a cleric or celestial creature of moderate power or was crafted by (Or crafted from) a being with magic in their very blood such as a sorcerer, fey creature or extraplanar being. Whatever the case, the object retains just enough magical essence for it to be considered a magical weapon for the purposes of overcoming resistances, damage reduction and other defenses, but offers no bonuses to accuracy or damage. —Note: Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
4,"Impervious: The weapon is extraordinarily durable and any wielder can plainly feel the solid construction under its unyielding form. The weapon could be made from a higher quality material than normal, reinforced with metal struts, rivets or bands, been marked with magical or divine sigils of protection and abjuration, or have been made by a labor intensive process that isn't commonly used such as folded steel, spell sung wood or damascus steel. The weapon is five times more durable than normal, never breaks, chips or dulls as a result of casual use and is all but impossible to break or damage as a result of combat, even when targeted by enemies who attempt sundering or weapon breaking techniques. Thrown weapons and ammunition with this benefit are always easily recoverable after combat ends. —Note: Depending on your game system the weapon may either have five times as many hitpoints or have a greatly increased hardness or damage reducing quality. If there is no existing system in place and weapons simply break or do not break as a result of damage, consider giving the weapon five “charges” or “lives”. Each time it would be broken as a result of damage, it instead remains fully intact but losses a life or charge and it is destroyed when all five have been used up."
5,"Relentless: This weapon is designed to cause two wounds in a single blow. It sports additional spikes, barbs, blades, blunt edges or is weighted in a way that whenever the wielder lands a blow he can hit the target again on the back swing of the same attack. Ranged weapons may have an additional bowstring or are crafted in such a way to place a mild spin on the projectiles causing them to penetrate while turning, causing more serious wounds without sacrificing accuracy. In thrown weapons and ammunition, barbs and serrated edges rip and tear at the victim's flesh upon impact which facilitates this effect. Although this can compromise the effectiveness of the weapon's main feature, the overall design raises the weapon's lethality. Whenever the wielder successfully hits a target instead of rolling the standard damage die, the player instead rolls an additional die that when combined equal the maximum value of the original damage die and add the results together. —Note: For example, a halberd that dealt 1d10 now deals 1d4+1d6, a shortsword goes from 1d6 now deals 2d3 and a greatsword goes from 2d6 to 3d4. The wielder still only makes a single attack roll for the multiple dice and the damage type does not change. For simplicity's sake, the DM should make a permanent decision on which kinds of dice are rolled. Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired"
6,"Superior: The weapon's cutting edge, bludgeoning surface or sharpened point is of far better quality compared to others of its kind. The symbol of a well respected weaponsmith or master craftsman is etched on the weapon's grip, marking it as a rare and valuable piece. The weapon's damage dice increases by one step to the next largest die. —Note: For example, if a normal dagger deals 1d4 damage, a Superior dagger deals 1d6. If the weapon already uses the largest die possible or practical such as a d10 or d12, the weapon now deals 1d10+1d2 or 1d12+1d2. Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
7,"Cruel: This object will never be mistaken for anything but a weapon. In addition to its main damaging feature, it bears, spikes, sharp blades, serrated edges, studs, or barbs all of which are meant to further the weapon's lethal qualities. These designs are favored by pit fighters, seasoned mercenaries, professional murderers and others who care only to kill their opponent as quickly and effectively as possible. There is no such thing as a glancing blow from this weapon, even the slightest hit will tear flesh and draw blood. In projectile weapons this bonus represents stronger limbs and strings, allowing a larger building of kinetic force that passes into the ammunition, speeding it to its final destination, an unwilling target. Whenever the player roll a 1 on a die to calculate the weapon's damage, they can reroll the die until they receive a result that is not a 1. —Note: This only affects the weapon's damage die itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects. Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
8,"Defensive: The weight of the object is expertly distributed over its length with a focus on additional weight on the weapon's grip. This change, along with a modified reinforced grip designed to shelter the hands and wrists, allows the wielder to easily recover into a ready stance after attacking and make better use of the weapon as a parrying device. The weapon grants +1 to the wielder's armor class / defense value / dodge rating or other system mechanic that decreases the chances of being hit with an attack. —Note: Not recommended for ammunition or thrown weapons."
9,"Vicious: The physical attributes of this weapon seem to be designed to wound an enemy's sense of sight as much as the rest of their body. The weapon sports large spikes, sharp blades, metal bands, serrated edges, studs, or barbs that the wielder can use to further damage the target in the event of a poor initial strike. Ranged weapons may have an additional bowstring or are crafted in such a way to place a mild spin on the projectiles causing them to penetrate while turning, causing more serious wounds without sacrificing accuracy. These additional features can be difficult to use correctly and although they are better to have than not, it's a gamble as to their effectiveness. Whenever the player roll a 1 or a 2 on a die to calculate the weapon's damage, they can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. —Note: This only affects the weapon's damage itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects. Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
10,"Brutal: Whether its a sharp blade, piercing end, or blunt edge, the business end of this weapon is exceptionally well made. Despite the obvious professionalism involved with its crafting, the weapon has no distinguishing, embellishments, decoration, ornamentation or even a maker's mark. The weapon almost raw in design without a single ounce of material that is not absolutely vital for the weapon to function. Despite all the lack of finery (Or perhaps because of it) the wielder can feel a primal, almost barbaric urge when they use the weapon in combat. The weapon makes no attempt to pretend that it's anything other than a tool of violence and that energy is channeled into the wielder's attacks. Whenever the player rolls the maximum result on a weapon damage die (I.e. a 6 on a six-sided die.), they can roll that die an additional time and add both results to the total damage dealt. This ability can trigger multiple times per turn but only once per attack. —Note: Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
11,"Mighty: The business end of this weapon is professionally crafted but its true value seems to be in the beautiful presentation of the entire object. The weapon seems to be more of a work of art than a tool of destruction and violence. It sports gold or silver filigree, gemstone studs, platinum banding, expert carvings, detailed etchings or decorative enchantments that serve to draw attention to itself. The weapon's adornments are durable and it never chips, dents, dirties, or becomes scratched, even while being used to cave in a goblin's skull. Despite all the lack of subtlety (Or perhaps because of it) the wielder experiences elegant, almost grandiose sensations when they use the weapon in combat, as if they were performing combat rather than fighting. The weapon is as deadly as it is beautiful, as the craftsman strove for singularity powerful blows as much as they did physical perfection. Whenever the wielder scores a critical hit with the weapon, the player can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add the result to the damage dealt by the critical hit. This is in addition to the standard bonus damage of a critical hit. —Note: This only affects the weapon's damage die itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects. Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
12,"Silvered: The weapon's business end is covered in a durable layer of alchemically treated silver of incredible quality. Although unnaturally processed, the metal is pure and effective at dealing with undead, lycanthropes and fey creatures. The silversmith or weaponsmith who applied the silver plating went about the task with precision and expertise and the weapon is no less effective with the coating than a typical one of its kind. The weapon's grip also sports discrete bands of intricately worked silver which prevents the wielder's supernatural enemies from handling the weapon and using it against him."
13,"Tactical: The weapon has been modified in a variety of ways designed to improve the effectiveness of specialized combat maneuvers. Often this takes the form of large barbs or hooks, serrated blades or an improved weight distribution that allows the wielder to better hinder, harass, and hobble his opponent. The hooks and counterbalancing greatly improves the wielder's ability to trip, feint, grapple, pin, disarm, sunder, push and shove his opponents and the wielder gains advantage on any such combat maneuver type roll where the weapon was involved. Alternatively, the target gains disadvantage to resist the attempt, whichever is better for the wielder. The weapon makes it far easier for even a middling wielder to perform complex combat stunts. Using an action equivalent to making an attack or casting a spell, the wielder can attempt to perform one of the previously mentioned combat maneuvers. Whenever the wielder could make an attack with the weapon, he can instead perform one of the previously mentioned combat maneuvers. This follows the standard rules within the game system for resolving combat maneuvers and if none exist see Note. Furthermore, the wielder is able to take advantage of lucky blows and turn them into skillful maneuvers rather than simply powerful attacks. Whenever the wielder lands a critical hit, he can choose to cause it to be considered a normal hit instead and immediately perform one of the previously mentioned maneuvers (With advantage because of the weapon's design) on the target. Trading the extra damage for the maneuver does not consume any additional actions or movement. —Note: For a contesting combat maneuvers the wielder declares the maneuver and chooses to make either a Strength or Dexterity check which is contested against the target's Strength or Dexterity check (Target chooses the ability to use). If the wielder has the higher result, the target falls prone, disarmed of one object their holding, knocked back five feet, grappled, etc. If the target wins the contest, there is no effect and the action is consumed without effect. Recommended for melee weapons only, although certain throwing weapons or ammunition such as bolas or arrows designed to disarming or tripping could certainty be beneficial to a PC."
14,"Poisoner's: The weapon's business end sports a series grooves and channels that allow it to hold poison more effectively until the weapon strikes its victim. The grooves may be carved in a geometric pattern or artistic image to better conceal their nature from casual observers and the gouges may be painted black or other noxious colour to better disguise any toxic coating. Even a bludgeoning weapon that is normally difficult to poison effectively can benefit from the grooves, allowing it to deliver the offending material with ease. The channels are always positioned in such a way that a creature can apply a solid or liquid material (Such as but not limited to: poison, holy water, flammable oil or animal venom) in them without any risk of accidentally poisoning themselves (Even if they are not proficient with poisons) and taking no more time than usual to coat an object with poison. Furthermore, the recessed pathways protect the material from the elements, keeping it from drying or spoiling and after it's applied, the material remains potent for an additional hour longer than normal before becoming inert. Lastly and most importantly, the virulent trenches are divided and spread out, allowing a single dose of poison to be delivered normally and effectively while still having some leftover in a separate groove. The number of strikes the weapon may make before the poison is rubbed off is increased by one. Alternatively to being spread out, the blighting substance can be confined to a single groove which will deliver its payload in a single concentrated strike which causes the victim to suffer disadvantage on the save against the material, or the PC can roll the poison's damage twice and choose the higher result. The bearer who applies the poison chooses whether the material will be spread out over multiple strikes or if it will be concentrated into a more lethal hit (And if it applies disadvantage or increased damage) when the material is applied. —Note: Not recommended for projectile weapons. This bonus provides a few benefits to the wielder in order to allow a lower level PC better make use of expendable items like flammable oil, holy water or poison before magical weapons and stronger spells render them too inefficient to use in combat. The DM should feel free to adjust any parts of this bonus to better fit with the specific poison mechanics of their game."
15,"Bypassing: A weapon with this benefit is fashioned in such a way to skirt, avoid, or otherwise circumvent an enemy's defensive shield. Depending on the type of weapon this bonus will manifest itself in a number of different ways. In melee weapons this most often takes the form of a backwards curving hook or bill just under the business end of the weapon. The wielder performs a feinting glancing and allows the weapon to be deflected by the shield but then hooks the bill on the shield and pulls backwards, knocking the target off balance enough to strike forward again and land the actual blow. Bludgeoning weapons can have their business end separated from the shaft and grip by a short length of chain essentially creating a specialized flail. Even if blocked, the chain wraps around behind the armor and strikes the target. Slashing and piercing weapons can have their business ends bent backwards at about a sharp 45° angle or a looping curve, allowing the blade or sharpened point to hook around in behind the shield to injure the target. Ranged weapons and ammunition have a slight spin or curveball type nature to their flight so that they'll hit just next to where the target's shield actually is. Alternatively they might bear a series of confusing array of colors or geometric shapes which disorient the target, making it nearly impossible to determine exactly where to hold the shield properly so that it will block the projectile. A wielder who makes an attack with a weapon with this bonus ignores any and all defensive benefits that an opponent's shield would normally provide. —Note: Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
16,"Resounding: This oddly is made weapon with a number of “sweet spots” that maximizes the wielder's strikes to the absolute limit of its lethal potential. This may be a fluke or design flaw that happens to be beneficial, a weaponcrafting technique meant to be used in conjunction with a specific martial style that can consistently land the powerful blows or a prototype of a superior set of weapons where the “sweet spot” would be the entire business end of the weapon, thus creating a set of true masterworks. To land a resounding blow, the attack must be connect with the target while a number of factors are all being met at the same time such as (But not limited to) the weapon's velocity, angle of hit, the structure of the armor (Or lack or armor) the target has in relation to the weapon's material composition, as well as possible magical influences. In ranged weapons this often takes the form of holding the weapon in a specific technique, the distance towards the target, air humidify, the projectile's velocity, environmental air speed and even strong magical aura's influencing the ammunition's trajectory. The ability to accurately strike in such a fashion to reliably utilize the weapon's true might is more of an art form than a science and it is by pure luck that a wielder hits just the right spot in the right way. Whenever the player rolls a damage die he must roll a second confirming die of the same sort. If the second die is the same result as the first, the player is considered to have instead rolled the maximum possible result for that type of die instead of the current result. If there are multiple dice, the players rolls a second set of dice as a confirmation roll and the lowest pair of doubles is maximized. —Note: Combat example: The wielder attacks with a resounding halberd, hits and rolls 1d10 damage. The first damage die is a 4 and the confirming die is also a 4. Since the rolls match, the wielder deals 10 damage instead of 4. If the confirming die was a 7 the wielder would deal the original 4 damage. A critical hit with a greatsword would be 4d6 with the results of the damage roll, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the confirmation roll 1, 2, 5, 6. The 1's would be maximized so the final result would be 6, 2, 3, 4 which would be a 15 rather than the 10 it would have been. This only affects the weapon's damage itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects. I recommend that the player or DM assign a color system so avoid confusion, for example the first die is always blue and the confirming die is always red. This way both dice can be rolled at the same die to speed the process along."
17,"Chargebreaker: This weapon seems to have taken a number of design inspirations from the common boar spear and allows its wielder to prepare defensive measures against an oncoming enemy. Physically the weapon is slightly longer than average and has a noticeably larger than normal cross guard or quillons, or has them at all if the weapon typically lacks the feature. The grip of the weapon is heavier than normal but specially weighted so that the wielder would naturally hold it at a 45° angle, outward from their body. The wielder can capitalize on this natural ready position by sinking into a defensive stance, readying themselves to attack the first enemy that approaches them. On the wielder's turn, he can spend half of his total movement to enter a bracing stance, readying himself and the weapon in a defensive position. While in this stance, the wielder is able to make an attack of opportunity with the readied weapon against an enemy creature that enters his reach. The bracing stance ends after the attack of opportunity is made or at the start of the wielder's next turn. —Note: Only recommended for melee weapons."
18,"Parrying: A weapon with this benefit has a number of catching or deflecting features, allowing it to be used to parry incoming attacks. The weapon typically sports an improved hand and crossguard as well as a reinforced length and improved quality of construction to better disperse the shocks of the enemy's blows. The weapon may sport a second set of quillons farther up along its length to function as a first wall of defense before an enemy's blade reaches anywhere near the wielder's hands. The business end of the weapon may be far wider than normal or flared out, allowing the wielder to casually glance an enemy's weapon off the tip of his hammer, sword or spear. The combination of the various defensive enhancements allows a wielder to potentially block melee attacks made against him that he is aware of. Using an action equivalent to an attack of opportunity (See Note) the wielder may attempt to parry an incoming melee attack, increasing his armor class or physical defensiveness as if he was properly wielding a shield. The wielder may benefit from the armor class bonus (Typically a +2) even if he is already wielding a shield. —Note: If your system doesn't use attacks of opportunity use the following rule: Once the wielder parries an attack he is no longer able to do so until the start of his next turn."
19,"Strategic: The weapon's overall design has been slightly altered in a number of ways, allowing it to better function as a deterrent against specialized combat techniques. The object's weight is redistributed differently compared to a standard weapon of its type with a focus on denser materials around the grip. This handholds are designed to easily pivot the weapon around the wielder's person and combined with a heavier grip, the wielder is easily able to keep the weapon in hand, functioning as a physical barrier between himself and his enemy. As a further defensive measure, weapons with this bonus often sport larger than normal crossguards or curling spikes to ward off foes that try to get to close or to attempt to wrestle the wielder. Overall these modifications greatly improve the wielder's ability to resist trips, feints, grapples, pins, being disarmed, pushed or shoved and the wielder gains advantage on any rolls checks made to resist such combat maneuvers. —Note: Not recommended for ammunition or throwing weapons."
20,"Adaptable: The weapon is a truly lethal implement and has a collection of physical improvements meant to provide alternative methods of defeating the enemy. The weapon has been modified to allow the wielder to deal different types of damage than the weapon is typically capable of. Invaluable for roving adventures and traveling monster hunters who may run into creatures who are resistant or completely immune to certain types of damage and who wish to carry just one weapon rather than waste their time and energy carrying several bulky weapons at once. It also provides the added benefit of allow the wielder to subdue an civilian or relatively innocent bystander without killing them and raising the ire of the guards or risking the loss of additional gold from a live bounty. Bludgeoning weapons are counterbalanced with a axe-like blades and topped with sharpened points. Slashing weapons are tipped with spear-like heads and bear larger, heavier, ridged pommels allowing the wielder to pummel a foe. Piercing weapons have accentuated bladed points capable of penetrated or cutting and either the business end or grip is weighted to provide a makeshift club. Furthermore, a small section of the weapon (Typically next to the bludgeoning end) has been covered in layers of leather, rubber or resin creating a painful but relatively safe point of contact. When the wielder attacks the PC may choose to have the weapon deal the standard type of damage the weapon typically deals, or instead have it deal either bludgeoning, slashing, piercing or nonlethal / stun damage (See Note). The weapon otherwise has the same statistics and this does not change anything about the way the weapon operates other than its damage type. —Note: Not recommended for projectile weapons. If your game system does not use damage types and this bonuses would provide no mechanical benefit, roll again. When a creature takes nonlethal /stun damage, keep a running total of how much they've accumulated. Do not deduct the nonlethal damage number from their current hit points. When the amount of nonlethal damage exceeds the creature's current hit points, they fall unconscious but stable. If this is too annoying to manage, simply allow that when the wielder reduces a creature to 0 hit points with an attack, the wielder can knock the creature out, leaving him unconscious but stable."
21,"Twinned: Rather than one single businesses end like a typical weapon, this object has two smaller identical lethal points. While it is difficult to gain the full combat benefits of having the doubled weapon, it is no less lethal than a standard one of its kind. A bludgeoning weapon for example may have two smaller warhammer next to each other. The reduced impact area of each face delivers a more directed impact making it just as dangerous to be struck by and twice deadly to be struck by both creating two spaced out injuries. A singular bladed or piecing weapon might be split partly down the middle like an overeager fuller, doubling the amount of sharp edges and stabbing points, while making the blade lighter and more maneuverable. Ranged weapons are modified to fire two pieces of ammunition simultaneously (This can be ruled as fluff description for balance so the wielder doesn't actually use twice as much ammunition) potentially doubling the chance of injury to the target. Not surprisingly, the larger and more complex the weapon, the harder it is to actually make use of the twinned business ends. It is fairly easy to stab a creature with a two pronged dagger but it is far more lethal to successfully cleave an enemy in half with a halberd bearing two forward facing, sharped crescent blades that slice into the target. Whenever the player rolls a damage die he must roll a second confirming die of the same sort. If the second die is the same result as the first, the player adds both dice to the total damage rolled. —Note: Combat example: The wielder attacks with a twinned halberd, hits and rolls 1d10 damage. The first damage die is a 6 and the confirming die is also a 6. Since the rolls match, the wielder deals 12 damage instead of 6. If the confirming die was a 10 the wielder would deal the original 6 damage. This only affects the weapon's damage itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects. I recommend that the player or DM assign a color system so avoid confusion, for example the first die is always blue and the confirming die is always red. This way both dice can be rolled at the same die to speed the process along."
22,"Quickdraw: A weapon with this bonus has been created with an impressive, ergonomic design that allows it to be effortlessly drawn forth by the wielder. Even the sheath, straps or carry clips have undergone modifications so that the wielder can easily make adjustments to stow it in wherever is most comfortable for them while still being instantly accessible. This allows the bearer to place the weapon in an area on their body where their hands instinctively go to as a response to combat or stressful situations. The bearer is able to draw the weapon as a free action whenever he rolls initiative as long as he physically capable of doing so. The weapon is so naturally drawn forth that the wielder is even able to impulsively (If crudely) defend himself in the heat of the moment and in the first round of combat if a hostile creature comes within the wielder's reach (Or 20 feet for a ranged weapon) he is able to make an attack of opportunity against that creature but suffers disadvantage on the attack roll. Lastly, drawing and stowing the weapon is considered a free action. To benefit from the weapon's bonuses, the bearer must have spent at least one hour adjusting the weapon and its sheath in the most optimal position for his own unique frame and habits. Once comfortable, the bearer only has to readjust the straps if the weapon has been changed to be used by someone else."
23,"Unforgiving: The grisly looking weapon has been designed to be extraordinarily effective during powerful finishing attacks. The wielder is able to manipulate the weapon to great effect when landing strikes that hit the target's vital areas and the additional features cause the implement to be particularly lethal on decisive attacks. Whenever the wielder scores a critical hit with the weapon, the player may select any single damage die of his choosing (See Note) and that die will be considered to have rolled the maximum possible result for that type of instead of the current result. This must be done after damage is rolled but before it is dealt to the target. —Note: This affects the weapon's damage itself AND other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects."
24,"Reach: A weapon with this bonus sports a number of features all designed to extend the wielder's effective threat radius, allowing him to attack enemies that would normally be out of reach. A melee weapon might have a longer haft or blade, or have a bludgeoning end on a short length of chain, allowing the blunt surface to be snapped out at a distant enemy. The weapon might be abnormally balanced or telescopic, allowing it to be overextended with ease, giving the wielder the ability to strike at range without falling over or leaving themselves exposed to retaliatory attacks. Ranged weapons with this quality sport thicker bowstrings and enhanced limbs, launching the projectiles even further than normal. Ammunition and thrown weapon bear aerodynamic grooving, masterful fletching, and weight distribution all meant for them to fly farther than they normally would. Melee weapons with this bonus add 5 feet to the wielder's reach when he attacks with it, as well as when determining his reach for opportunity attacks with it. Ammunition, ranged and thrown weapons all add 20 feet to their normal and long distance attack ranges. There is however a downside to these modifications, as the weapons were originally designed to be shorter and smaller for good reasons. While the improved length and extended reach excel at hitting a foe from afar and keeping the fight at bay, they make it difficult to properly attack an enemy that is immediately adjacent to the wielder. Melee Reach weapons are cumbersome in close quarters and the wielder suffers disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within 5 feet of himself. Ranged weapons and projectiles with this bonus are meant for longer flights, making them difficult to aim properly without being given distance to stabilize causing the wielder to suffer disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within 10 feet of himself."
25,"Rebounding: The weapon is roughly half as heavy as a typical one of kind, made of lightweight materials arranged in an interconnected fashion that renders it just as durable as a standard weapon of its kind. In the grip of Rebounding melee weapons rests a core of rubbery, springy substance that causes the weapon to bounce back slightly with each hit aiding the wielder to get back into a fighting stance a fraction of a second faster than a normal. On particularly powerful blows, the weapon rebounds with enough force that the wielder can try to stab or swing again at the same spot, aggravating the severe injury even further. Projectile weapons with this bonus are crafted in such a way to place a mild spin on their ammunition causing them to corkscrew into the wound creating a hideously maiming injury if the wielder lands the shot just right. In thrown weapons and ammunition, the objects are designed to shatter on impact, hopefully leaving debris in the target's body or potentially spraying shrapnel over the victim creating a wide area of serious lacerations. Following up with a secondary attack or landing a projectile in optimal area is a combination of luck and skill and not always possible. Whenever the wielder scores a critical hit he can attempt to confirm the followup strike. The player immediately makes another attack roll (See Note) with all the same modifiers as the initial attack. If the wielder's confirmation attack roll also results in a hit against the target's armor class, the followup attack is successful and the wielder deals additional damage on the critical hit equal to the maximum result of one of the weapon's damage dice (Like an 8 on a d8) the player rolled for the attack's damage. The confirmation roll just needs to be enough to hit the target normally, it doesn't need to be a critical hit again. If the secondary attack roll would be considered a miss, then the initial attack is still considered a critical hit. —Note: This secondary attack role is not another true attack and does not take an action or use any resources. A combat example: A PC wielding a Rebounding Mace rolls a natural 20 against the target and attempts a secondary attack roll. The PC then rolls another attack to confirm the critical and gets a result of 18, which is less than the target's armor class of 15. Since the confirmation rolls is a hit, the PC will add +8 (Assuming that the mace uses 1d8 for damage) damage to the normal damage resulting from the critical hit."
26,"Decisive: The weapon has been shaped and formed with the precise eye of a master crafter. Built in a way to reward accuracy and efficiency, the bladed edge, sharpened tip or contact point has been reinforced with a small amount of a stronger, denser material. This substance is exceedingly rare and exorbitantly expensive even in such a minute quantity but it is enough to greatly increase the weapon's lethality, if the wielder is skilled enough to hit the target just right. Although the weapon is no less lethal than one of its peers in the hands of an amateur, only a true professional killer in favorable conditions can really drive the rare material of the weapon hard into the enemy. Whenever the wielder attacks with advantage and hits the target, if the lower of the two d20 results would have also hit the target, the player can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add the result to the damage dealt by the attack. —Note: This works best in the D&D 5e Advantage / Disadvantage concept. In other systems the extra damage might kick in if the PC would have hit the target with its straight d20 roll without bonuses or if the attack roll exceeded the target's AC by 5 or more. This only affects the weapon's damage die itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects. Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
27,"Hooked: The weapon bears a number of curling, spikes, backwards pointed hooks or is curved much more than a typical one of its kind. These crooks and grapples can catch on the enemy's weapons, shields, legs and arms allowing the wielder to push and pull the target off balance. In an odd design quirk, these offensive anchors are placed in such a way that they can only way to properly utilized on the backswing of a particularly accurate blow. Ranged weapons are crafted in such a way to place a mild spin on the projectiles causing them to penetrate while turning, creating injuries designed to maim. In thrown weapons and ammunition, barbs and serrated edges which facilitates the same effect. While difficult to achieve, the benefit of this construction is that the precise nature of the hooks combined with the well landed blow denies the target a chance to properly defend themselves. Whenever the wielder attacks with advantage and hits the target, if the lower of the two d20 results would have also hit the target, the player can choose to either trip, grapple, disarm or shove the target five feet backwards and that combat maneuver automatically succeeds. —Note: This works best in the D&D 5e Advantage / Disadvantage concept. In other systems the bonus might kick in if the PC would have hit the target with its straight d20 roll without bonuses or if the attack roll exceeded the target's AC by 5 or more. Projectile weapons with this improvement bestow the bonus upon their ammunition for the turn that it's fired."
28,"Cunning: The weapon is a model of combat utility making it perfect for harrying and debilitating opponents rather than directly injuring. The business end is undersized leaving room for a variety of modifications making it simple to perform specialized combat maneuvers. Often these takes the form of large barbs or hooks, serrated blades or an improved weight distribution that allows the wielder to better hinder, harass, and hobble his opponent. The hooks and counterbalancing greatly improves the wielder's ability to trip, feint, grapple, pin, disarm, sunder, push and shove his opponents. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a target, instead of rolling damage he can choose to deal the minimum result possible on his weapon damage roll (Like a 1 on a d8) and immediately attempt to make one of the previously mentioned combat maneuvers checks against the target. These follow the standard rules within the game system for resolving combat maneuvers and if none exist see Note. ------Note: This affects additional damage dice from critical hits but not die from other sources such as divine smite, sneak attack or spell effects. If your system doesn't have rules for a contesting combat maneuvers, use this: The wielder declares the maneuver and chooses to make either a Strength or Dexterity check which is contested against the target's Strength or Dexterity check (Target chooses the ability to use). If the wielder has the higher result, the target falls prone, disarmed of one object they're holding, knocked back five feet, grappled, etc. If the target wins the contest, there is no effect and the action is consumed without effect. Recommended for melee weapons only, although certain throwing weapons or ammunition such as bolas or arrows designed to disarming or tripping could certainty be beneficial to a PC."
