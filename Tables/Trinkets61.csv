1,"A rough-hewn amber stone that gives the bearer a sense of peace, and even a glimmer of hope for salvation."
2,"A strange figurine of a cloaked phantom. Carved from a smooth and lusterless black stone, the surface seems to soak up the light around it giving the entire piece a remarkable feel. The mysterious figure is crouched low and seems to be slipping through the air like smoke. Its spectral aspect looks familiar somehow."
3,"A perverse and gaudy replica of an ordained Sester's mask. When this mask is worn, the spirit feels nebulous, boundless even. The vast distances between each being dissolves, revealing a vision of the world beheld by a thousandfold eyes."
4,"A tall silver-plated candle holder shaped like a dragon's claw."
5,"A map, which shows in painstaking detail how to navigate the ring of deadly reefs around a distant island. A point near the middle of the island is marked with an X. There is no hint as to what 'X' might actually be."

10,"A pawn shop's ticket that says the bearer can present this receipt along with payment in full to retrieve their necklace that has been sold into hock in a nearby city. The writing states that the bearer will have to pay Roll 5d4 gold pieces, which is 10% of the total estimated value of the jewelry. The stub says that if the necklace is not claimed within the next Roll 5d20 weeks that ownership of the item will fully pass to the pawnbroker. For proper claiming purposes, the ticket has the first sentence of the following description written on it: ^AllNecklaces^"
11,"A folded letter; it's been read hundreds of times. It's a bittersweet goodbye from one lover to another and the details too intimately private to rewrite here."
12,"A sealed jar of foggy glass that that is always unnaturally cold. When touched, the artificial chill penetrates the bearer's skin before his mind registers the presence of the brain within. It's connected to a pair of free-floating eyes, which flash as the organs that once moved a body squirm and squiggle in their new home. An observer can also make out the gibbering movements of what was once a mouth but is now reduced to a puddle of gore and goop."
13,"A copper thumb from an autognome."
14,"A broad leather pouch containing a set of glassblower's tools including several metal tubes in loops. One has a broad, conical end.

18,"An empty velvet satchel with flecks of glimmering dust inside that hint at what it once held."
19,"A large hand-drawn poster, featuring the steps to a simple waltz for two marked by footprints and arrows, and accompanying music recorded below. The dance it describes is sharp and harsh, littered with sudden stops and performed with quick, cutting movements in time to the music's staccato rhythm. When performed as written, the dance lasts just over three minutes."
20,"A sheet of papyrus covered in images of the sun in different art styles."
21,"A clay pot filled with a reddish paint meant to be worn by a berserker. Made from clay taken from the bank of a river where many battles were fought, this warpaint contains the lingering malice of the warriors who perished there."

36,"A set of three bulbous clay whistles, shaped to resemble nude humanoid figures, with emphasized sex organs marking the place where one has to blow into the whistle."
37,"A richly decorated box with no obvious lock or hinges, but a wooden switch on top. If the switch is activated, a secret compartment releases a mummified hand that crawls up and turns the switch off again. It then returns to its compartment and closes the cover."
38,"An incense holder made of bronze and inlaid with ivory. The general shape is that of a sleeping cat."
39,"An iron belt buckle depicting the eyes and fangs of a spider."
40,"A featureless mask of rough, unvarnished hardwood."
41,"A medal for outstanding gallantry on the field of battle. The nation which awarded it no longer exists. Turns out it takes more than gallantry to win a war."
42,"A wax-sealed glass jar filled with preserved rose petals, seeds, thorns and leaves. The survival of all humankind is tied to this item, so says the Edaerian Prophecy."

47,"A silver gorget, embellished with hammered relief of an orchard."
48,"A box of high-quality costume jewellery: obviously fake on close inspection, but from a distance it'll look as though the bearer is wearing a king's ransom. Handy if for baiting a trap, or for pretending that one is richer than they are."

50,"An oil painting of a bleak looking, late autumn forest."
51,"A thick pamphlet on which is written a fiery political tract, full of stirring revolutionary rhetoric, cataloguing the crimes of the ruling classes and calling upon the people to rise up. It is cleverly written to appeal to a wide audience and rile up a mob in a hurry and would be worth some-thing to a political agitator."
52,"A felted brown toy goat that bleats when squeezed."
53,"A glass perfume bottle that creates a cascade of illusory cherry blossom petals when spritzed. It smells of cardamom and cinnamon."
54,"A dusty, floppy purple velvet hat with a broken egret plume on one side."

56,"A stone statuette in the shape of a tree with its branches twisted around a bronze disk for the moon."
57,"A silver brooch in the shape of a raven's skull, filled with dried flowers."
58,"A prayer-wheel made of a smooth wooden spindle topped with a stone wheel engraved with a meditative mantra. Whenever the object is grasped, flashes of someone else's emotionally poignant memories flash in the bearer's mind as if long forgotten but suddenly remembered; A holy man once gave it to you: he said that anyone who had shed as much blood as you had obviously needed it more than he did.

63,"A leather wallet containing several pages of sheet music labelled “The Xanthous Ballad”. The ancient and yellowed parchment is covered in looping handwriting almost too faded to see.

70,"A metal plate decorated with nude figures and maps of local quasars."
71,"An ancient silver burial coin. One side shows an image of the skeletal boatman Charon. The reverse shows an eye which would be placed over the corpse's eyes to supposedly pay for the passage to the afterlife."
72,"A muck-covered glass jar filled with small, white, writhing worms that possess haggard human faces. If the jar is opened, thrown at something or otherwise destroyed, the worms shed their skin and take the form of tiny white flies, chuckling jovially as they flutter off into the air. They laugh as though they know something you do not."
