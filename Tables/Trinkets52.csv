Upon imbibing, the drinker of Cray's Crazy Cider of Creation feels calm, a soothing wave caresses their body but they can feel the strange brew changing inside them. 1d6 hours after consuming enough of the cider, the drinker will feel sick and harmlessly regurgitate a Random Trinket.

Bubbly as it could possibly be, the liquor colors the drinker's sense of taste with a light orchid flavor hinted with clovers. The vodka fizzes up an obscene amount when swallowed. Every shot taken causes the drinker to burp grotesquely, and quite generously, for 30 to 40 seconds. Knowledgeable PC's are aware that it is a local favorite in the City of Jestero."

From there, go east for 2-3 miles, until you find the crossroads, then go north-east for 1-2 miles and you'll find the reserve protected by magical wards. ---Note: It is up to the DM whether or not if the instructions can be followed (The “landmarks” might be a code, riddle or simply not exist for example) and if there is anything at the end.
